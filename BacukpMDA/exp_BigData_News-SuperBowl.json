Two more? Joe Flacco. At this time last year, Ryan and Flacco were quarterback prospects generating considerable questions, and Atlanta and Baltimore were losing teams embarking on rebuilding. Then the Falcons chose Ryan, the Ravens maneuvered for Flacco and the rest is playoff history. As rookies, Ryan and Flacco proved that adept drafting really can instantly reverse a franchise's fortunes. Is Matthew Stafford, out of Georgia, the next Ryan or Flacco? And who will have the nerve to find out Saturday if Stafford or Southern California's Mark Sanchez can make the transition as smoothly? Quarterbacks are always the draft-day stars, but this draft is loaded with offensive linemen and receivers. With not much delineation between players who could go in the first few picks and the middle of the first round - the draft analyst Gil Brandt said he believed there were 23 players who could be taken in the top 10 - and so much money due players who go in the first few spots, expect the teams near the top of the draft list to try to trade down to get more bang for their buck. Here is a look at each team's needs going into the draft. (Position of first-round picks in parentheses.) AMERICAN CONFERENCE East Buffalo Bills (11, 28) No draft pick is going to change the Bills more than Terrell Owens will, but getting a tight end and shoring up the offensive line would help Owens, too. And the Bills have to upgrade in the pass rush, which was awful last year. Jets (17) At least one of the top three quarterbacks could still be on the board when the Jets pick in the first round. Moving on from the messy Brett Favre experiment is the Jets' greatest need. But if they stick with a training-camp battle between Kellen Clemens and Brett Ratliff, they have to get a big-time wide receiver to ease their quarterback's path. New England Patriots (23) With 4 of the first 58 picks - and with holes in the secondary and at running back filled in free agency - Coach Bill Belichick can add more youth and speed to his defense. Miami Dolphins (25) Their needs do not seem quite as desperate as last year's, but to keep the progress going, the Dolphins need upgrades at receiver and across the board on defense, especially at cornerback. North Cleveland Browns (5) Whoever becomes their starting quarterback will find major issues at receiver, including Donté Stallworth's legal situation. But with Eric Mangini in charge, they will try to rebuild the pass rush, too. If linebacker Aaron Curry is on the board when Cleveland picks at No. 5, he will be tempting. Cincinnati Bengals (6) The Bengals have spent their last four first-round picks on defense. Now it is time to shore up the offense again. Carson Palmer's elbow should be healthy again, but to keep it that way, the Bengals need reinforcements on the offensive line. If they really want to make Palmer feel good, they will get him a pass-catching tight end or another receiver. Baltimore Ravens (26) Now that the Ravens have solved a decade-long quarterback problem with Flacco, they could use a top-notch receiver from a deep class to pair with him. Pittsburgh Steelers (32) The Super Bowl champions are some of the best drafters around, so expect them to go for a cornerback to replace Bryant McFadden and perhaps another offensive lineman. South Jacksonville Jaguars (8) The Jaguars should get one of the top players in the draft. They can use it -- at wide receiver, on both lines, and at linebacker and in the secondary. Houston Texans (15) With the dynamic offense in great shape, it will be all defense, all the time for the Texans. Look for them to go for linebackers and defensive backs. Indianapolis Colts (27) There has been a lot of change with the Colts -- farewell, Tony Dungy, and good luck finding another job, Marvin Harrison -- but as in recent years, the defense needs a few upgrades, particularly at linebacker and on the interior defensive line. Any offensive picks are for depth only. Tennessee Titans (30) The Titans do not need much to remain competitive. They have already replaced the departed Albert Haynesworth, but could use quality pickups at wide receiver and at linebacker to fill out a strong roster. West Kansas City Chiefs (3) Almost everybody expects that General Manager Scott Pioli will take Wake Forest linebacker Aaron Curry, perhaps the best player in the draft, with the third pick to address the Chiefs' woeful pass rush and begin building a defense in the Patriots' image. Oakland Raiders (7) If JaMarcus Russell is ever going to become a real force, he is going to have to have a go-to receiver. The Raiders don't have anything close right now. Denver Broncos (12, 18) The Broncos have a boatload of picks from the Jay Cutler trade, 2 in the first 18 over all. Despite an active free agency, they need a lot of help in shifting their defense to a 3-4. But the questions remain: Is Kyle Orton really their quarterback, or will they take one this year? San Diego Chargers (16) The biggest addition will be getting Shawne Merriman back, but the Chargers lost Igor Olshansky this off-season, and finding a defensive end to replace him is a priority. NATIONAL CONFERENCE East Washington Redskins (13) From Dan Snyder's off-season activity, you might think the Redskins need a quarterback. Not so much. They do need an offensive tackle and help on the defensive line and at linebacker. But Snyder likes to ''win'' free agency and the draft with splashy acquisitions, so don't rule anything out. Philadelphia Eagles (21) For a conference finalist, the Eagles need plenty: a running back to take some heat off Brian Westbrook, a go-to receiver for Donovan McNabb and reinforcements for both lines and the secondary. Oh, yes, and somebody who can possibly replace Brian Dawkins's leadership. Giants (29) Even before they sent Plaxico Burress packing, the Giants needed a receiver. Now the need for a tall, red-zone threat is more acute than ever. Maybe a Braylon Edwards trade will finally come together, but if it doesn't, the Giants have to find Burress's replacement. Dallas Cowboys (none) You cannot draft peace and quiet, which is what the Cowboys need most of all. In lieu of that, the Cowboys need depth on the offensive line and on defense. But this is still a talented team and the departures of Adam Jones, safety Roy Williams and Terrell Owens can only help. North Detroit Lions (1, 20) When you're 0-16, what don't you need? The new coach, Jim Schwartz, comes from the defensive side, and the Lions need help front to back on defense. But if they're going to pay the big money that the first overall pick commands, they need a quarterback - and a franchise face - who can lead the long rebuilding slog. Plus, Matthew Stafford actually wants to play for Detroit. Green Bay Packers (9) Don't blame Aaron Rodgers for the Packers' downfall last year. He got little help from the running game and an ineffective offensive line, and the defense was dreadful. Green Bay is switching to the 3-4 defense, which means it needs a nose tackle. Minnesota Vikings (22) Let's assume they are going to choose between Tarvaris Jackson and Sage Rosenfels at quarterback. The Vikings had better protect whomever they choose - last year they gave up 43 sacks, making the drafting of a tackle a near necessity. Chicago Bears (none) The Bears have already made their biggest acquisition of this off-season, when they traded for quarterback Jay Cutler. They don't have a pick until the 49th over all, but they'll need a No. 1 receiver to keep Cutler happy and a cornerback so that Cutler doesn't find himself in too many shootouts. South New Orleans Saints (14) Drew Brees and his offensive teammates can set all the records they like, but if the Saints don't upgrade their defense, it will be for nothing. Jonathan Vilma could use some help at linebacker. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (19) The Buccaneers still don't have a franchise quarterback and they could draft one. But they also need a lot of parts for their gutted defense, particularly in the front seven. Atlanta Falcons (24) They got the offense straightened out faster than anybody imagined. Now it's time for help on defense, especially on the defensive line. Carolina Panthers (none) On paper, the Panthers don't need much to contend again. But if they wind up trading the disgruntled defensive end Julius Peppers, it will leave an enormous hole in the pass rush that they will have to fill immediately. West St. Louis Rams (2) Their fingers are probably crossed that the Lions don't take tackle Jason Smith, who could replace Orlando Pace. They also need a receiver to take over for Torry Holt. Lucky for the Rams, this draft is flush at both positions. Seattle Seahawks (4) Their passing defense was abysmal last season, so they could use the fourth overall pick on a pass rusher. San Francisco 49ers (10) Maybe it's time to finally give up on Alex Smith and draft a quarterback. The Niners could move down and still get Mark Sanchez or Josh Freeman if Matthew Stafford doesn't somehow fall to them. Arizona Cardinals (31) That passing game sure is exciting, but how about another running back to bring some balance, and to relieve some pressure on the not-getting-any-younger Kurt Warner?", "headline" : { "main" : "Draft Needs, Team by Team" }, "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "6", "word_count" : 1612, "snippet" : "   There are two words that should give every N.F.L. team hope when the draft starts next Saturday: Matt Ryan.

If you need pigeonholes for your napkins, no wine choices because the owner's brother-in-law makes Beaujolais, a dependable blanquette de veau every Tuesday, and the neighborhood plumber sitting in the corner, you're out of luck. But if you want a small, cozy place, reasonably comfortable, with reliable and affordable food, it may be that the choices are better than they have been in years. That's my experience, anyway. The food in the places discussed here is often inventive but never silly, with the occasional deconstructed classic making an appearance, but a sound one. The atmosphere is friendly enough.

When they dare to reveal genuine passion or irreverence, though, we pound away at them for displaying insufficient self-control. Such was the case with Barack Obama's recent and calamitous news conference, when the president plunged headlong into a debate over race relations. A barrage of criticism, which followed Obama's extemporaneous comments, centered on his use of the word ''stupidly'' to describe the behavior of the Cambridge police. But perhaps the more jarring if overlooked moment in Obama's answer came just before that, when he endeavored to cast himself in the place of his friend Henry Louis Gates Jr., whose trouble began when he needed to break into his own home. ''I mean, if I was trying to jigger into -- well, I guess this is my house now, so it probably wouldn't happen,'' the president said. Then he flashed a mischievous grin and added, ''Here I'd get shot.'' It's hard to imagine an edgier joke than this -- the nation's president, its first black president at that, teasing about being gunned down in the White House foyer. Had Obama not gone on to malign a cop, it almost certainly would have dominated the next day's punditry. And yet the moment was in keeping with what we have learned about Obama in the months since his inauguration. The president, it turns out, is quite funny -- and sometimes a little reckless. Obama had to make his first apology just days after being elected president, for joking about Nancy Reagan's séances. He ran into trouble with advocates for the handicapped in March, when he suggested to Jay Leno that his bowling on the campaign trail belonged in the Special Olympics. And before the Super Bowl, he angered fans of the singer Jessica Simpson by appearing to make light of her supposedly ballooning weight. (Fortunately for Obama, fewer than a dozen of those fans are old enough to vote.) You have to have a pretty determined sense of aggrievement -- or just a dim view of the president generally -- to take genuine offense at such throwaway one-liners. And yet they tend to obscure, if only for a day, Obama's more serious objectives, undermining the comedian in chief's reputation as an innately disciplined politician.", "headline" : { "main" : "Funny How?", "kicker" : "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW" }, "abstract" : "Matt Bai article on Pres Barack Obama's flash of humor during press conference in which he commented on arrest of Harvard Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr; suggests Obama is quite funny, but sometimes his humor borders on reckless; cautions that his throwaway one-liners can often obscure his more serious objectives and undermine his reputation as disciplined politician; says what defines Obama's humor is its distinctly postmodern premise; photo (M)", "print_page" : "9", "word_count" : 1044, "snippet" : "Barack Obama’s sense of humor gets him into trouble.

With Favre, the Vikings' coaches may be tempted to open up the passing game and that could be a mistake. Favre can still throw the ball a mile -- the question is, who will catch it? He has a partially torn rotator cuff and is coming off surgery. These hardly seem the ingredients for an improvement in the 40-year-old Favre's play over last year, when he led the Jets into a late-season collapse with an avalanche of interceptions? If Favre can limit his interceptions -- the late-season five-year trend is not promising -- the Vikings will be one of the N.F.C. teams to beat for a Super Bowl spot. But if he is closer to the Jets' version of Favre, the Vikings, and Coach Brad Childress, will be in trouble. As it is, they will have a tough time holding off the Bears for the division title. The Chicago Bears finally have a franchise quarterback -- cue the Sid Luckman retrospectives. Jay Cutler is one of the best young quarterbacks in the league, and running back Matt Forte should have another strong year, particularly because the Bears also upgraded their offensive line. Still, the thought of Cutler's teaming with Devin Hester on the deep pass has the Bears salivating, because playing with the lead helps a defense that in the last few years has had to do much more than its share to keep the Bears in games. We'll find out how good the Bears are early: they open at Green Bay and then play the Steelers, but it could come down to the regular-season finale between the Vikings and the Bears to determine the division champion.

While those two consumed preseason attention, Belichick's New England Patriots have the most important comeback story of the regular season and, if all goes as expected, the postseason. For those living under a rock -- or in Philadelphia or Minnesota -- Tom Brady is back from his knee injury. While the contributions of Vick and Favre remain the subject of much speculation, the expectations for Brady are simple: get the Patriots back to the Super Bowl. They came within a whisper of making the playoffs without him -- kudos to Belichick for adaptability -- and during the off-season engineered a considerable roster makeover, upgrading the secondary with Shawn Springs and Leigh Bodden. Then they added Fred Taylor, one of those aging running backs Belichick works wonders with, and receivers Joey Galloway and Greg Lewis. As a result, the Patriots could pick up where they left off in 2007, blowing out opponents for much of the season. Their offense will get two good tests in October -- against the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans, with a game against the Denver Broncos in the middle -- before they play in London against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (This is the N.F.L.'s idea of a marquee game?) If Brady holds up, anything short of an appearance in the A.F.C. championship game will be a letdown. The Patriots thump you over the head with greatness. The Miami Dolphins delight you with shock value. But repeating their division title will be tough, and not just because of Brady. The Dolphins have a brutal schedule -- the toughest in the league, if you go by how opponents finished last season -- and they could easily start 0-3. It is also hard to imagine linebacker Joey Porter's matching the season he had last year.

Houshmandzadeh, the most talented receiver he has ever had. Other than injuries, the problem last year -- and potentially this year -- is the defense. It was terrible in 2008, particularly against the pass, not a good thing when you are in the same division as Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald. End Patrick Kerney is returning from an elbow injury, which should help the pass rush. The Seahawks owned this division until half the team went on injured reserve last season. If their health holds up, they should overtake the Cardinals. One thing working against the Arizona Cardinals: for a Super Bowl runner-up, they had an unusual amount of off-season tumult. Both coordinators are gone to the Kansas City Chiefs. Anquan Boldin spent the off-season upset about his contract. And Warner got a few months older. Todd Haley left to become the Chiefs' head coach, but the offense he left behind is incredible, particularly the other-worldly Fitzgerald. If Fitzgerald plays during the regular season anything like the way he did when he took over the playoffs, the Cardinals' offense cannot be stopped. Unless Warner gets hurt. The good news is the Cardinals filled a gaping need when they drafted Chris Wells, a hulking running back who can provide the ground game that was absent last season.

If Tomlinson and tight end Antonio Gates return to full health, the offense, second in scoring in the league last year, should lead the Chargers to an easy division title (San Diego finished 8-8 and still won the West last season). How much further they go may depend on the defense, which should return to form with the return of the pass rusher Shawne Merriman, in whose absence the secondary was exposed. But with Merriman back and more depth on the defense, the Chargers could be poised to make a deep run in the playoffs. They had better hurry, because the window is closing fast on this group. Whither the Denver Broncos? They were cruising to a division title last season but since then have stumbled into the N.F.L.'s alternate universe. They collapsed, losing the title and sending Mike Shanahan into temporary coaching exile. The new coach, Josh McDaniels, decided Matt Cassel was preferable to Jay Cutler, which annoyed Cutler, who threw a fit and forced a trade -- not for Cassel but for the Bears' Kyle Orton, who threw three interceptions in the first preseason game and is uncertain for the Broncos' opener with an index finger injury. And don't forget Brandon Marshall's getting upset about his contract and being suspended for part of the preseason. The Broncos also cannot count on much from an abysmal defense that was not upgraded.

The Giants remain the favorite because at the nitty-gritty of football -- line play and the running game -- they are among the best. The defensive line has been bolstered by the additions of Chris Canty and Rocky Bernard (although the line has also been hit by injuries in the preseason). The most important addition is the return of end Osi Umenyiora, who missed 2008 with a knee injury. The defense was still fifth in points allowed and had 42 sacks. The offensive line is superb and the running game with Brandon Jacobs can be devastating. The Giants were headed for another deep run in the playoffs, and perhaps a chance to defend their Super Bowl title, before Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg last November, and the offense screeched to a halt. Burress is gone and so is Amani Toomer, but the Giants drafted receiver Hakeem Nicks. Still, Eli Manning, who signed a huge contract extension, may not have to make many clutch passes to win. With this running game and defense, the Giants can play conservatively and still be a Super Bowl favorite. The Giants' defense will have to worry about a new wrinkle when they play the Philadelphia Eagles, their closest competition. Michael Vick is almost certain to be used in Wildcat-type plays, where, Coach Andy Reid has hinted, he and Donovan McNabb could be on the field at the same time, with one of them lined up at receiver. But the Eagles' Super Bowl chances hinge much more on McNabb than on Vick. If the McNabb of late last season is the one who shows up this year, the Eagles are in good shape. If he is the one who was so bad against the Ravens that Reid benched him, you can expect a quarterback controversy. Otherwise, the Eagles are loaded. The defense lost the coordinator Jim Johnson, who died in the off-season after fighting cancer. Still, this is another superb defensive line and a great defense, and unless Brian Westbrook gets hurt and McNabb falls apart, this is another Super Bowl-caliber team.", "headline" : { "main" : "East", "kicker" : "N.F.C.

The Steelers did not change much in the off-season, but why change when almost everything works so well? The line has to protect Roethlisberger better and the running game has to improve -- can Willie Parker finally stay healthy? -- to take some heat off the quarterback. But the defense has to do nothing but be as great as it was last season, which seems a given because of its coordinator, Dick LeBeau, who is starting his 51st year in the N.F.L.
