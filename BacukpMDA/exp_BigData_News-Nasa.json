The valves are used to regulate the flow of hydrogen gas from the main engines to the external fuel tank.

Back then, women cheered the arrival of sheer hosiery. Now it's the men's runways that are filled with shiny nylon (and nylonesque) windbreakers. Prada's hangs off the shoulders with a strap, Patrik Ervell showed a featherweight poncho in gold and cream, and Dior Homme paraded black and gold versions. Nylon has always been used for both fashion and function, with practicality usually gaining the upper hand. During World War II, nylon production shifted from stockings to parachutes and tents, but with the development of low-cost nylon fabrics, the stage was set for a postwar boom. In 1949, Haspel Clothing promoted nylon suits with the slogan ''A crisp and new-as-tomorrow look.'' Soon after, men were dressing in basics like the Ike jacket, nicknamed for General Eisenhower. When James Dean wore a red windbreaker in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955), it became a classic. A decade later, the skiwear company Bogner was dressing James Bond for the slopes, but reality soon trumped make-believe with the nylon-coated aluminumized spacesuit worn by John Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts. The '70s and '80s were all about high-tech nylon variations like Cordura: these were embraced by sailors like Dennis Conner, whose team won the 1988 America's Cup in nylon-bonded uniforms. Today nylon shows up in work wear from old pros like Carhartt and Dickies, mountain-climbing outerwear from Northface, Nike's windbreakers and the unitard developed by Speedo for Michael Phelps. In fact, this garment, together with the gear worn by bike messengers, was the inspiration for Duckie Brown's show, where nylon leggings were combined with synthetic shorts and crinkly jackets. Seven decades into nylon's history, it seems that fashion may finally be trumping function.

Lately, however, since coming ''out of the closet as far as global warming is concerned,'' as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors' letter boxes and Dyson's own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described as ''a pompous twit,'' ''a blowhard,'' ''a cesspool of misinformation,'' ''an old coot riding into the sunset'' and, perhaps inevitably, ''a mad scientist.'' Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the mass cultivation of specially bred ''carbon-eating trees,'' whereupon the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded -- there are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford -- and suggested that ''perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can give directions to lost hikers.'' Dyson's son, George, a technology historian, says his father's views have cooled friendships, while many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else. There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the 20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone -- out of his beautiful mind. But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, Dyson's friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the case. ''His mind is still so open and flexible,'' Sacks says. Which makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose intelligence is revered by other scientists -- William Press, former deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him ''infinitely smart.'' Dyson -- a mathematics prodigy who came to this country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory -- not only did path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Witten, the ''high priest of string theory'' whose office at the institute is just across the hall from Dyson's.

A twelfth generation American, his ancestors from both the Ruffin and Warfield sides of his family arrived in Virginia and Maryland respectively around 1645. Tom was an accomplished businessman from a very young age. Following in the footsteps of his famous ancestor, he ran a small, but successful farming operation in Hampton, Virginia at the age of 13. An exceptional student, he graduated Cum Laude from Washington and Lee University and attended Harvard Business School as the youngest in a class of 600. After spending three years in the Coast Guard as a Navigator on the CGC Mariposa, Tom pursued a career in finance. He worked at Standard & Poor's, Goldman Sachs, White-Weld & Co., and Morgan Stanley before opening his own investment management firm, Warfield Associates, in 1983. He presided over the firm until early 2009. Between 1984 and 1996 Tom maintained a successful horse racing business based in Belmont Park, NY. His pride and joy Mr. Bluebird won two high profile stakes races only three weeks apart in November 1996. Tom was also a member of the Knickerbocker Club in NYC. Tom's father, Calvin N.

It merely allows polluters and Wall Street traders to fleece the public out of billions of dollars. Supporters of cap and trade point to the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments that capped sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-burning power plants -- the main pollutants in acid rain -- at levels below what they were in 1980. This legislation allowed power plants that reduced emissions to levels below the cap to sell the credit for these excess reductions to other utilities whose emissions were too high, thus giving plant owners a financial incentive to cut back their pollution.
