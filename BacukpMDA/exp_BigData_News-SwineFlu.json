Paul Dergarabedian, of Hollywood.com Box Office, told Reuters he expected a massive opening of somewhere between $80-million and $100-million. That would be considerably more than the $65-$75 million that many other box office analysts were predicting. Box Office Guru, for instance, predicts $74 million, including Thursday night's \"preview\" screenings. EW's Hollywood Insider goes lower, guessing $65 million. Paramount, which is releasing the film, was trying to keep expectations low, saying some of its recent research pointed to an opening closer to $50 million. It's a particularly difficult opening to predict, analysts said, because no one really knows how many hard-core fans will accept this new, younger cast or whether younger audiences will want to engage with their parents' sci-fi franchise.

Mr. Horn had previously committed himself to serving until the end of Mr. Bloomberg's second term in January. But the John Jay position would start in the fall. The mayor urged him to take the teaching post. Mr. Horn was the probation commissioner when he was also named the Department of Correction commissioner in 2002.

Eight months after Mr. Horn became correction commissioner Mr. Seabrook said Mr. Horn was ''incompetent to run this agency.'' But on Tuesday, Mr. Seabrook said he wished Mr. Horn well.

(13, 49) PLACE OF EXECUTIONJuliet Stevenson stars as Catherine Heathcote, a television journalist and single mother bent on solving the 1963 disappearance of a 13-year-old girl whose body was never found -- despite a murder conviction in the case. In flashbacks more than 40 years earlier, Lee Ingleby plays George Bennett, a high-level police official whose career took off with the case and who is now the subject of Catherine's latest documentary. Philip Jackson is George as an older man. Greg Wise, above with Ms. Stevenson, plays the girl's arrogant stepfather; Tony Maudsley is George's garrulous sergeant; and Elizabeth Day is Catherine's rebel daughter, who can't stand her mother but is fascinated by her project. Then there are the suspects: a schoolmate (Mikey North) who had secretly kept photographs of the victim, and the victim's uncle (Ryan Anthony-Jones), a known sexual offender. But most troubling are the local villagers, who for more than four decades have withheld information. This two-part ''Masterpiece Contemporary'' production is based on a thriller by Val McDermid (''The Wire in the Blood''); David Tennant (''Dr. Who'') is host. Part 2 will be broadcast on Nov. 8 at 9. 8 A.M. (NBC) MEET THE PRESS Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
