Nostalgia, grief, fear for our planet and a subdued resolve in the face of advancing years arrive together in the Hawaii-based Merwin's 22nd collection of new poems, which won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize. As in all of his verse since the late 1960s, Merwin does away with punctuation, letting line breaks and sense determine syntax and pace. The results suggest whispers, laments, accounts of long-ago memories, even voices from an underworld: ''the dead are not separate from the living,'' he says; ''each has one foot in the unknown.'' Looking back at old photographs and childhood houses, at horse pastures and ''splintery unlit'' schoolrooms, Merwin represents faint consolations, autumn and nightfall, and a parent's dying words: ''All day the stars watch from long ago / my mother said I am going now / when you are alone you will be all right.'' Lines move forward almost ceremonially, confident in the simplicity of their diction, like ''clear water revealing / no color but that of the gray / stone around it.'' As he has before, Merwin writes gravely of species in peril, among them our own: endangered bats and departed songbirds ''were singing of youth / not knowing that they were singing for us.'' Yet most of the work in this capacious book considers not the earth's mortality but Merwin's own: poems shift from his first years to his most recent (he will turn 82 this September), from the helplessness of a young child to the profound resignations of old age.", "headline" : { "main" : "Poetry Chronicle" }, "pub_date" : "2009-08-02T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : "Stephen Burt Poetry Chronicle notes books The Shadow of Sirius by W S Merwin, Archicembalo: Poems by G C Waldrep, Tryst by Angie Estes, and Selected Poems by Eileen Ni Chuilleanain edited by Peter Fallon; photo from book Photography after Frank by Philip Gefter (M)", "print_page" : "16", "word_count" : 1135, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/books/review/Burt-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "width" : 398, "url" : "images/2009/08/02/books/burt-500.jpg", "height" : 500, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 398, "xlargeheight" : 500, "xlarge" : "images/2009/08/02/books/burt-500.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "creative_works", "value" : "SHADOW OF SIRIUS, THE (BOOK)" }, { "name" : "creative_works", "value" : "ARCHICEMBALO (BOOK)" }, { "name" : "creative_works", "value" : "TRYST (BOOK)" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "CHUILLEANAIN, EILEAN NI" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "FRANK, ROBERT" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "FALLON, PETER" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "MERWIN, W S" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "ESTES, ANGIE" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "WALDREP, G C" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "GEFTER, PHILIP" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "POETRY AND POETS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "BOOKS AND LITERATURE" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "firstname" : "Reviews", "middlename" : "Stephen", "lastname" : "BURT", "rank" : 1, "role" : "reported", "organization" : "" } ], "original" : "Reviews by STEPHEN BURT" }, "section_name" : "Arts; Books" }
