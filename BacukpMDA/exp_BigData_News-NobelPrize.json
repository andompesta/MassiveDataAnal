Though nearly 50, Yu, who wears his hair short and spiky, looks relatively young. He speaks in emphatic bursts, his face often flushing red, and he is quick to laugh. It was, in fact, his boisterous laugh that almost got him into trouble on the morning of the solemn announcement of Mao's death. Responding to orders that blared out from loudspeakers, he assembled with hundreds of other students in the main hall of his small-town high school. ''Funereal music was played, and then we had to hear the long list of titles that preceded Mao's name, 'Chairman,' 'Beloved Leader,' 'Great helmsman . . . ,' '' Yu recalled. ''Everyone loved Chairman Mao, of course, so when his name was finally announced, everyone burst into tears. I started crying, too, but one person crying is a sad sight; more than a thousand people crying together, the sound echoing, turns into a funny spectacle, so I began to laugh. My body shook with my effort to control my laughter while I bent over the chair in front of me. The class leader later told me, admiringly, 'Yu Hua, you were crying so fervently!'

As in the trilogy, historical figures mingle with invented ones, the terrors of war are meticulously described and there is much talk about the function of art in wartime.

Krugman, a Princeton economist and New York Times Op-Ed columnist who won the Nobel Prize last year, argues that the extreme inequality in the contemporary United States results from political choices, not economic laws. The book's strongest chapter makes the case for universal health care. Krugman ''discusses complex economic questions with rare lucidity,'' Peter Beinart wrote in The Times, and his arguments for ''fundamentally changing -- or changing back -- the relationship between America's government and its citizens'' will ''prove vital'' to the new administration.

Because for the first time since the early 19th century, American poetry may be about to run out of greatness. That may seem like a strange (and strangely fraught) way of putting things. But the concept of ''greatness'' has a special significance in the poetry world that it often lacks elsewhere -- after all, in most areas of life, greatness is to be cherished, but it isn't essential. The golf world idolizes Tiger Woods, sure, but duffers will still be heaving 9-irons into ponds long after Woods plays his last major. Poetry can't be as confident about its own durability. Poetry has justified itself historically by asserting that no matter how small its audience or dotty its practitioners, it remains the place one goes for the highest of High Art.

October 13, 1918-February 19, 2009. Edward Rozek passed away at his home of natural causes on February 19, 2009. A professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado, he was born and raised in Poland. After the country was overrun by Hitler and Stalin, he escaped via Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Italy to France. There he joined the First Polish Armored Brigade which took part in the defense of Paris. After France fell, he made his way to England. He became commander of a platoon of tanks in the 10th Reconnaissance Regiment of the First Polish Armoured Division, which fought from Normandy to northern Germany. He was wounded three times. The last time he was blinded by an anti-tank land mine and spent 10 months in English and Scottish hospitals. He received four Purple Hearts, three Crosses of Valor, four British war medals, and Polonia Restituta Officer Class and Komandoria. He ended his military career with the rank of Major. In 1948, the British Government gave him, as a former officer, a one-way ticket to anywhere in the world. He chose to take the Queen Mary to America. He arrived with no family, only $50 and a suitcase full of books. After working on a dairy farm and then a gas station to earn college tuition, he was admitted to Harvard where he earned three degrees: A.B. (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa), A.M. and Ph.D. In 1956, he became a professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado. He directed the Central and East European Studies Program for 25 years and was deputy editor of the Journal of Central and East European Affairs. He founded and for 34 years directed the Institute for the Study of Economic and Political Freedom. He also founded and directed from 1972 to 1999 the Center for Science and Technology, which organized numerous conferences in which several Nobel Prize winners and other distinguished scholars from American and European universities participated. He lectured at many universities and public institutions in the United States, Europe, South Korea, the Republic of China, and South Africa. Professor Rozek wrote several books. The best-known is Allied Wartime Diplomacy, for which he received the National Book Foundation Award. The American philosopher Sidney Hook dedicated his book, Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy, as follows: \"To Edward J. Rozek---Embattled fighter for free men, free society and the free university against fascism, communism and totalitarian liberalism.\" CU students elected him Professor of the Year and Distinguished Faculty Member. After teaching for 43 years at the University of Colorado, Professor Rozek retired in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he held the Endowed Garnsey-Rozek Professorship in Economics and Political Freedom at the University of Northern Colorado. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, Professor Rozek was a member of Ronald Reagan's Advisory Council on Defense and Foreign Policy. He was an honorary member of the legendary Solidarity of Poland and received Knighthood in the Venerable Order of St. John, which was founded around 1100 AD. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; his sons, Christopher and Jonathan, and four grandchildren, Alexander, Philip, Thomas and Christina.

October 13, 1918-February 19, 2009. Edward Rozek passed away at his home of natural causes on February 19, 2009. A professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado, he was born and raised in Poland. After the country was overrun by Hitler and Stalin, he escaped via Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Italy to France. There he joined the First Polish Armored Brigade which took part in the defense of Paris. After France fell, he made his way to England. He became commander of a platoon of tanks in the 10th Reconnaissance Regiment of the First Polish Armoured Division, which fought from Normandy to northern Germany. He was wounded three times. The last time he was blinded by an anti-tank land mine and spent 10 months in English and Scottish hospitals. He received four Purple Hearts, three Crosses of Valor, four British war medals, and Polonia Restituta Officer Class and Komandoria. He ended his military career with the rank of Major. In 1948, the British Government gave him, as a former officer, a one-way ticket to anywhere in the world. He chose to take the Queen Mary to America. He arrived with no family, only $50 and a suitcase full of books. After working on a dairy farm and then a gas station to earn college tuition, he was admitted to Harvard where he earned three degrees: A.B. (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa), A.M. and Ph.D. In 1956, he became a professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado. He directed the Central and East European Studies Program for 25 years and was deputy editor of the Journal of Central and East European Affairs. He founded and for 34 years directed the Institute for the Study of Economic and Political Freedom. He also founded and directed from 1972 to 1999 the Center for Science and Technology, which organized numerous conferences in which several Nobel Prize winners and other distinguished scholars from American and European universities participated. He lectured at many universities and public institutions in the United States, Europe, South Korea, the Republic of China, and South Africa. Professor Rozek wrote several books. The best-known is Allied Wartime Diplomacy, for which he received the National Book Foundation Award. The American philosopher Sidney Hook dedicated his book, Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy, as follows: \"To Edward J. Rozek---Embattled fighter for free men, free society and the free university against fascism, communism and totalitarian liberalism.\" CU students elected him Professor of the Year and Distinguished Faculty Member. After teaching for 43 years at the University of Colorado, Professor Rozek retired in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he held the Endowed Garnsey-Rozek Professorship in Economics and Political Freedom at the University of Northern Colorado. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, Professor Rozek was a member of Ronald Reagan's Advisory Council on Defense and Foreign Policy. He was an honorary member of the legendary Solidarity of Poland and received Knighthood in the Venerable Order of St. John, which was founded around 1100 AD. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; his sons, Christopher and Jonathan, and four grandchildren, Alexander, Philip, Thomas and Christina. Services were held at Sacred Heart of Mary Church in Boulder, CO on February 24.

Lately, however, since coming ''out of the closet as far as global warming is concerned,'' as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors' letter boxes and Dyson's own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described as ''a pompous twit,'' ''a blowhard,'' ''a cesspool of misinformation,'' ''an old coot riding into the sunset'' and, perhaps inevitably, ''a mad scientist.'' Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the mass cultivation of specially bred ''carbon-eating trees,'' whereupon the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded -- there are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford -- and suggested that ''perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can give directions to lost hikers.'' Dyson's son, George, a technology historian, says his father's views have cooled friendships, while many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else. There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the 20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone -- out of his beautiful mind. But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, Dyson's friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the case. ''His mind is still so open and flexible,'' Sacks says. Which makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose intelligence is revered by other scientists -- William Press, former deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him ''infinitely smart.'' Dyson -- a mathematics prodigy who came to this country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory -- not only did path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Witten, the ''high priest of string theory'' whose office at the institute is just across the hall from Dyson's.

Probably no senator thinks back nostalgically to the beloved uncle who proudly broke his back every day for 40 years working in the reinsurance business. To a lot of politicians and White House aides, G.M. isn't simply another failing company looking for a handout; it's as much a symbol of middle-class aspiration as the tract house and the Disneyland vacation. Of course, this deep familiarity we have with G.M. and its cars can cut the other way too.

Steinn's grand, egotistical journey (''I have no waking interest in anything but perfection'') begins with art and ends with God, taking a path marked out by tormented disquisitions on all manner of existential questions. It also takes a terrible toll on the lives of others, particularly his childhood companion Dilja, for whom Steinn was ''the only one she wanted to know, the only one she had ever planned to get to know.''

Dr. Furchgott was an extraordinary scientist who made major contributions to our understanding of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying the fundamental role that nitric oxide (NO) plays in the regulation of cardiovascular function. Dr. Furchgott discovered that the cells lining blood vessels produce a substance he called endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which induces vascular relaxation. He subsequently proposed that EDRF is nitric oxide. Dr. Furchgott's discoveries, conducted in his laboratory at SUNY Downstate, have helped scientists understand and find new treatments for cardiovascular diseases and other conditions ranging from immune disorders to memory loss, pulmonary disease, and erectile dysfunction. Dr. Furchgott also received a Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1991 and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1996. Dr. Furchgott's brilliant career spanned several decades at SUNY Downstate. Throughout his tenure he was an inspiration to SUNY Downstate's students, faculty, administration, and staff. In Dr. Furchgott's honor, the Robert F. Furchgott Society was established at Downstate to support students and fellows conducting basic science studies in a broad array of subjects.

Perhaps this is because of the elegance and majesty of the instrument itself, or because the very word ''piano'' is reassuringly beautiful. Or perhaps it is because I, like so many other baby boomers, have long dreamed of playing the piano but have had to settle for being able to strum a few primitive Neil Young songs on the guitar.

(Russell) Sopka, Ph.D.,former college teacher and scholar, of Marblehead, MA died July 30 at the Shaughnessy-Kaplan Hospital in Salem, MA.

She attended Girls Latin High School in Boston and Radcliffe College (now Harvard University) where she earned a Bachelors degree in physics. In 1943, she married John J. Sopka, from Elizabeth, NJ, they celebrated their 66th anniversary this spring. During the war, the couple was moved to Dayton, OH, where husband John was a physicist with the Manhattan Project and their first child, John R. Sopka, now of Groton, MA, was born in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard to complete their graduate degrees. Despite the birth of their other two children, Robert J. Sopka, of Catonsville, MD, and Elisabeth M. Sopka, formerly of Marblehead and now of Boston, MA, Katherine completed a Masters degree in physics while John completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics, both at Harvard. \"Mom told me just days before she died, that she was never, ever bored. The pattern of her life truly bears that out\", said Elisabeth. The family lived in Silver Spring, MD, Elizabeth, NJ, and Boulder, CO. Later she and husband John lived in Arlington, TX, Framingham, MA, and Durango, CO before finally relocating to Marblehead. In New Jersey, Katherine taught physics at Newark State Teachers College and later at the University of Colorado in Boulder. There she worked with Professors Frank Oppenheimer and David Hawkins on curriculum development for physics instruction including the PSSC Physics Project. Katherine worked with Professor Gerald Holton at Harvard in the History of Science Department with whom she completed her Ph.D. in 1976. Her dissertation details the development of quantum physics in the United States during the first part of the twentieth century. This research was later published by the American Institute of Physics as the book, Quantum Physics in America: The Years through 1935. Thereafter, she served as editor for the American Institute of Physics History of Modern Physics series of books. She conducted numerous interviews with many noted physicists, including Nobel Prize winners Van Vleck and Edward M. Purcell which are now at the Neils Bohr Library & Archives. Prof. Holton stated that \"Her skills as an interviewer were unparalleled, and I highly valued her as a collaborator. The interviews she conducted with the members of the Physics Department form a valuable record for Harvard University and are stored in their archives for future generations.\" Her last project was an account of the essential work performed at the Bonebrake Seminary in Dayton, Ohio and its contributions to the Manhattan Project. This little known, highly secret site was responsible for the trigger for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This work is to appear in Physics in Perspective.

(Russell) Sopka, Ph.D., former college teacher and scholar, of Marblehead, MA died July 30 at the Shaughnessy-Kaplan Hospital in Salem, MA. She was 88 years old and succumbed to the effects of a recent stroke. Born and raised in Dorchester, MA, Dr. Sopka was fourth of six siblings. She attended Girls Latin High School in Boston and Radcliffe College (now Harvard University) where she earned a Bachelors degree in physics. In 1943, she married John J. Sopka, from Elizabeth, NJ, they celebrated their 66th anniversary this spring. During the war, the couple was moved to Dayton, OH, where husband John was a physicist with the Manhattan Project and their first child, John R. Sopka, now of Groton, MA, was born in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard to complete their graduate degrees. Despite the birth of their other two children, Robert J. Sopka, of Catonsville, MD, and Elisabeth M. Sopka, formerly of Marblehead and now of Boston, MA, Katherine completed a Masters degree in physics while John completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics, both at Harvard. \"Mom told me just days before she died, that she was never, ever bored. The pattern of her life truly bears that out\", said Elisabeth. The family lived in Silver Spring, MD, Elizabeth, NJ, and Boulder, CO. Later she and husband John lived in Arlington, TX, Framingham, MA, and Durango, CO before finally relocating to Marblehead. In New Jersey, Katherine taught physics at Newark State Teachers College and later at the University of Colorado in Boulder. There she worked with Professors Frank Oppenheimer and David Hawkins on curriculum development for physics instruction including the PSSC Physics Project. Katherine worked with Professor Gerald Holton at Harvard in the History of Science Department with whom she completed her Ph.D. in 1976. Her dissertation details the development of quantum physics in the United States during the first part of the twentieth century. This research was later published by the American Institute of Physics as the book, Quantum Physics in America: The Years through 1935. Thereafter, she served as editor for the American Institute of Physics History of Modern Physics series of books. She conducted numerous interviews with many noted physicists, including Nobel Prize winners Van Vleck and Edward M. Purcell which are now at the Neils Bohr Library & Archives. Prof. Holton stated that \"Her skills as an interviewer were unparalleled, and I highly valued her as a collaborator. The interviews she conducted with the members of the Physics Department form a valuable record for Harvard University and are stored in their archives for future generations.\" Her last project was an account of the essential work performed at the Bonebrake Seminary in Dayton, Ohio and its contributions to the Manhattan Project. This little known, highly secret site was responsible for the trigger for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This work is to appear in Physics in Perspective.

Sally Hemings, the daughter of a slave woman and Thomas Jefferson's father-in-law (she was the half sister of his wife, Martha), lived with Jefferson for many years after Martha's death, and Gordon posits a love relationship between them. Their four surviving children were freed either when they reached adulthood or at Jefferson's death, and other members of the Hemings clan were house servants at Monticello. The book won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. DEATH WITH INTERRUPTIONS, by José Saramago. Translated by Margaret Jull Costa (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.95.) In this shrewd, ironic novel by the nearly 87-year-old Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize in 1998, death -- conceived as a spiteful female shape-shifter who has fallen in love with an unassuming cellist -- decides to stop killing people in an unnamed country.

Intimacy jostles with celebrity in this collection of more than 300 photographs. Intensely personal images chronicle the deaths of Susan Sontag, Leibovitz's friend and companion, and of her father six weeks later, as well as the births of her three children. Travels and family gatherings are memorialized. Then there are the celebrity portraits for which Leibovitz is famous: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Scarlett Johansson among them. Leibovitz says she considered doing a book of personal work, but decided that by itself it didn't constitute ''a true view of the last 15 years. I don't have two lives. This is one life.'' THE PASSPORT,by Herta Müller. Translated by Martin Chalmers. (Serpent's Tail, $12.95.) Set in a German village in Romania like the one where Müller grew up, this was the first of her novels to be published in English, back in 1989. Its protagonist is a miller who wants to emigrate to West Germany. Müller won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature. The 1988 laureate was Naguib Mahfouz; his CAIRO MODERN,translated by William M. Hutchins (Anchor, $15), was written in the 1940s and takes place a decade earlier. It concerns a nihilistic philosophy student who agrees, in exchange for a good job, to marry the mistress of an official. The novel ''is a singular look at a historical moment in the lives of Egyptians . . . whose existences were rocked by modernity,'' Dinitia Smith wrote in The Times. THE DREAMS,translated by Raymond Stock (Anchor, $15), collects short short stories -- some only a few paragraphs long -- written near the end of Mahfouz's life (he died in 2006).
