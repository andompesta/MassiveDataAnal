Joe replaced the car, more or less, with nothing, or rather, with an Idea, which he carried around in his wallet on a plastic card, lawn-green, embedded with a computer chip and prominently imprinted with a playfully mellow looking ''Z,'' for Zipcar -- an upstart company bent on altering the primal bond between Americans and their vehicles. Joe, who lives upstairs from me in a converted warehouse on a notably unleafy block of Park Slope, Brooklyn, is someone a love-struck marketer might regard as both demographically and ''psychographically'' ripe -- endowed, that is, with both the means and the mind-set to wade fearlessly into the waters of certain Next Big Things. He is 36, works in an advertising-related field, owns his business, dresses like a skateboarder, was an early adopter of the iPhone and of Obama and can be found outside our building on mild evenings chasing a soccer ball with his two young sons. Joe takes an active interest in picking up stray garbage and organizing the recycling bins and would be glad to know, incidentally, if there's anything he can do in his spare time to help forestall global environmental cataclysm. Dumping his car suited his profile. It was also a practical choice. The lease was expiring, and Joe's monthly tab, with insurance, approached a thousand dollars. That didn't include the cost of gas, which had risen, in the last months of 2007, to more than $3 per gallon. Then, too, there were the never-ending parking woes. Joe had chosen not to pay $300 a month to rent space in a local garage, but he wondered whether that was a net positive, given the mental and physical toll exacted by searching for on-street parking.", "headline" : { "main" : "Share My Ride" }, "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "36", "word_count" : 5157, "snippet" : "You may need a car, but do you need to own one  or even lease one?

Consider audio books. An enormous number of Americans read by listening these days -- listening aloud, I call it. The technology for doing so is diverse and widespread, and so are the places people listen to audio books. But from the perspective of a reader in, say, the early 19th century, about the time of Jane Austen, there is something peculiar about it, even lonely. In those days, literate families and friends read aloud to each other as a matter of habit. Books were still relatively scarce and expensive, and the routine electronic diversions we take for granted were, of course, nonexistent. If you had grown up listening to adults reading to each other regularly, the thought of all of those solitary 21st-century individuals hearkening to earbuds and car radios would seem isolating.

Since the spring, on most working days he is roused at 6:45 in the morning, surrounded by guards and packed into an armored van for the drive to court. For two hours each way, the man who once supplied 2 percent of the world's oil crouches in a steel cage measuring 47 by 31 by 20 inches. Convicted of tax evasion and fraud in 2005, Khodorkovsky now faces a fresh set of charges that add up to the supposed theft of $30 billion. In the dark of the van, Khodorkovsky tries to prepare for his trial, replaying in his mind his night reading, the daily stack of documents from his lawyers. But Russia's most famous prisoner worries too about what would happen if a car slammed into the van. (Collisions are routine in Moscow's clotted avenues.) ''Your chances of making it out alive,'' he wrote me one day this summer, ''at any speed, are next to none.'' Khodorkovsky (pronounced ko-door-KOFF-skee) has spent more than 2,200 days behind bars. He cannot receive reporters. Yet the ban has brought a revival of a dissident tradition dating back to Ivan Grozny and Prince Andrey Kurbsky in the 16th century: the epistolary exchange. For several months this year, from July until October, Khodorkovsky and I were able to conduct a series of exchanges -- as he has done with other correspondents, both foreign and native -- filtered through the hands of lawyers (who transcribe his oral replies) and avoiding the eyes of prison officials. In court, he has maintained that he fails to understand the case against him. The new indictment runs 3,487 pages but boils down to a single accusation: that the former C.E.O. of the Yukos oil firm and his deputy, Platon Lebedev, were part of an ''organized criminal group'' that stole 350 million tons of oil from their company between 1998 to 2003. The tonnage exceeds Yukos's production during the period in question.

Since the spring, on most working days he is roused at 6:45 in the morning, surrounded by guards and packed into an armored van for the drive to court. For two hours each way, the man who once supplied 2 percent of the world's oil crouches in a steel cage measuring 47 by 31 by 20 inches. Convicted of tax evasion and fraud in 2005, Khodorkovsky now faces a fresh set of charges that add up to the supposed theft of $30 billion. In the dark of the van, Khodorkovsky tries to prepare for his trial, replaying in his mind his night reading, the daily stack of documents from his lawyers. But Russia's most famous prisoner worries too about what would happen if a car slammed into the van. (Collisions are routine in Moscow's clotted avenues.) ''Your chances of making it out alive,'' he wrote me one day this summer, ''at any speed, are next to none.'' Khodorkovsky (pronounced ko-door-KOFF-skee) has spent more than 2,200 days behind bars. He cannot receive reporters. Yet the ban has brought a revival of a dissident tradition dating back to Ivan Grozny and Prince Andrey Kurbsky in the 16th century: the epistolary exchange. For several months this year, from July until October, Khodorkovsky and I were able to conduct a series of exchanges -- as he has done with other correspondents, both foreign and native -- filtered through the hands of lawyers (who transcribe his oral replies) and avoiding the eyes of prison officials.

Thus styled, the word has a hump in the middle. I could print it here to show you, but I refuse to allow my prose to be so disfigured. On account of the hump, midword capitals are sometimes called ''camel case.'' Other terms include ''intercaps'' and ''incapping.'' There is some precedent for the unsightliness.

The company was started by Kris Schrey, who said that when he tried to sell off his CDs a few years back he was humiliated by snarky music shop employees who ridiculed his musical taste and then lowballed him. Learning of the demand overseas for CDs and DVDs, Mr. Schrey started an online business through which a customer could mail in a CD library and receive an iPod, iPhone or other device based on the size of the collection. (An iPod can be had for 200 discs; more ground rules are at ipodmeister.com.) Last month the venture rented a 4,000-square-foot loft with a loading dock and a waiting room. Now customers can bring in their collections in person -- no ridiculing, Mr. Schrey promises.

PAPAYA KING, on the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 14th Street, was a familiar sight, with its yellow and red neon signs and a mural at the subway entrance claiming its hot dogs were ''tastier than filet mignon.'' One would think the inexpensive dog-and-fruit-juice outlet would thrive in this economy, but Dan Horan, chief executive of Papaya King, which has two other outlets in the city, said the company got an enticing offer to sell the remainder of its lease at the site. ''For me that place was New York,'' said Sara Harvey, 36, who moved here last year from South Carolina and works nearby. She liked the $4.59 special: a 16-ounce drink and two dogs with sauerkraut, onions or relish. Papaya King ''made this area feel like a neighborhood,'' she said.
