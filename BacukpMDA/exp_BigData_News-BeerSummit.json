To combat this, Whistler has unleashed a blizzard of ski-and-stay packages starting as low as 113 Canadian dollars a night (about $110 at 1.03 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar). HOW TO GET THERE The cheapest way to get to Whistler is to fly to Vancouver, B.C., and then take a shuttle 70 miles north. From Newark, nonstop flights to Vancouver in mid-January were under $400 round trip on Air Canada, according to a recent online search. Another tip: Book through Whistler's reservations center (888-403-4727; www.whistlerblackcomb.com), which often has fares 15 to 20 percent lower than published prices (plus, most fares are refundable, minus a cancellation fee). From the airport, shuttle transfers are available to Whistler on Pacific Coach Lines (800-661-1725; www.pacificcoach.com), from 57 Canadian dollars one way.
