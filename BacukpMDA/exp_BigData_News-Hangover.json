The only people in the modest, disconcertingly spotless greenroom were the opening acts: two smartly dressed, well-spoken, polite comedians in their early 30s, both of whom could have passed for architecture students, or graphic designers, or even grass-roots organizers for the Obama campaign. No entourage was in evidence; marijuana was alluded to, but never actually smoked; gourmet hummus and He'brew ale were partaken of, but only in moderation. And the headlining act, the reason for the capacity crowd buzzing with controlled impatience in the 300-person theater just a few feet down the hall, was not in the greenroom at all. He was crouched just offstage with his back to the curtain, running intently through ''Joy to the World'' with a trio of young tuba players he'd recruited that morning from Craigslist, looking less like one of the great new hopes of American comedy than the leader of a severely underfunded marching band. He didn't look like a comic at all, in fact, and he certainly wasn't acting like one. Which, as it turned out, was precisely the point. ''What I call the 'geography' of a room -- its size, its layout, the overall feel of the place -- really determines how far you can push things,'' the comic in question, a cherubic man with a fiery red beard and the distinctly unshowbizlike name of Zach Galifianakis, told me in the greenroom a short time before. ''I love to do shows in unlikely places, because the audience's expectations are less fixed. If you're going on right after a guy with suspenders and a skinny, 1980's-style comedy tie, who's been striking crazy poses -- doing the same type of material that worked in 1991 -- there's no space for trying unconventional stuff. A place like this, on the other hand, is more of a blank slate.'' Galifianakis took a deep, unsteady breath (the first sign of nervousness he'd shown) and stared down intently at the tips of his New Balance sneakers.

Ballard died in April of this year, talk of his long struggle with cancer should have prepared his followers (''fans'' is too pale a word for the devotion Ballard inspired), yet the news still came as a shock. Ballard was, unmistakably, a literary futurist, at ease in the cold ruins of the millennium a lifetime sooner than the rest of us; his passing registered as a disorienting claim of time upon the timeless. Whether you embrace or reject on his behalf the label ''science-fiction writer'' will indicate whether you regard it as praiseful or damning, but no one reading Ballard could doubt the tidal gravity of his intellect or the stark visionary consistency of the motifs that earned him that rarest of literary awards, an adjective: Ballardian. Now, and not a moment too soon, comes The Complete Stories of J. G. Ballard (Norton, $35), a staggering 1,200-page collection of a lifetime's labors in the medium in which Ballard was perhaps most at home. Each of Ballard's 98 short stories is like a dream more perfectly realized than any of your own. His personal vocabulary of scenarios imprints itself from the very first, each image with the quality of a newly minted archetype. Ballard was the poet of desolate landscapes marked by signs of a withdrawn human presence: drained swimming pools, abandoned lots littered with consumer goods, empty space stations, sites of military or vehicular tragedies. Himself trained in medicine, Ballard frequently chose doctors or scientists as protagonists and narrators, yet expertise never spares them from the fates they see overtaking others.
