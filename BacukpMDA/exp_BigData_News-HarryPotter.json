Writers like Scott Frank, Richard Curtis and Paul Attanasio have been making as much as $250,000 a week, for anywhere from two to six weeks, to rewrite existing scripts to the persnickety star's specifications, all in the hopes that Mr. Cruise will choose that project over the others. At the moment, Variety says, the leading contenders are \"Motorcade,\" a thriller involving a presidential procession, \"The Tourist,\" another thriller about an American abroad who gets mixed up with Interpol agents (including Charlize Theron) and \"Wichita,\" a romantic comedy about an undercover agent and a woman (Cameron Diaz) who has trouble with the men in her life. Also in the mix is \"The Matarese Circle,\" based on the Robert Ludlum novel, about a pair of spies, a project that would team Mr. Cruise with Denzel Washington. An older post here on Slashfilm includes more details about the competing projects.", "abstract" : "The Morning Take: Wed., April 22", "print_page" : null, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "multimedia" : [], "headline" : { "main" : "The Morning Take: Wed., April 22", "kicker" : "Carpetbagger" }, "keywords" : [ { "rank" : "1", "name" : "type_of_material", "value" : "News" } ], "pub_date" : "2009-04-22T11:28:08Z", "document_type" : "blogpost", "news_desk" : null, "section_name" : "Arts", "subsection_name" : null, "byline" : { "organization" : "THE EDITORS", "original" : "By THE EDITORS", "person" : [] }, "type_of_material" : "Blog", "word_count" : 688, "_id" : { "$oid" : "5356cf118859c57f07fe6a80" } }

Cobb). In ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1951), at 10, Mr. Malden also appeared with Brando and won the supporting-actor Oscar for his lovelorn Mitch, a bachelor who looks after his mother. And in ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962), at 12:15 a.m., he plays Harvey Shoemaker, a prison warden and the nemesis of Burt Lancaster's Robert Stroud, a lifer who becomes an expert on birds. 7 A.M.

Hollywood has learned not to underestimate this genre, and the film was in 3-D to boot, but there was some concern that families would be turned off by a marketing campaign that relied heavily on gun imagery. ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' (Warner Brothers) was a close second with about $30 million in sales and a new cumulative total in North America of $221.8 million. ''The Ugly Truth,'' a dismally reviewed romantic comedy from Sony starring Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl, was third with an estimated $27 million. ''Orphan,'' an R-rated thriller from Warner Brothers, opened in fourth place with a soft $12.8 million, hurt perhaps by protests from adoption groups.
