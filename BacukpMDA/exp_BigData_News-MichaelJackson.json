The older and mustier - with the cutest old ladies - the better.Music venue: United Palace Theatre, Washington Heights.Favorite concert: Neil Young in the city. I go every year - I think most go to hear him rock out. But I go and sit quietly in my seat, sitting on my hands and waiting for everyone else to leave the stage. He hooks on his harmonica and starts stomping, swaying and crying out loud. It breaks my heart every time and I can never get enough.Music: Anything dreamy and calm, old and new - Bob Dylan every time, CocoRosie, Beach House, old My Morning Jacket.Provisions: Candy; cookies; chips, cafe bustelo on the stove; sugar; salt; caffeine.For gifts: Books, cookies and notes/letters of sincerity. But if I had it my way, I'd give a puppy in a bow tie every time.Restaurant: WD-50 for a real meal, a snack or a drink; Paul's Da Burger Joint for a burger on an English muffin, cheese fries, onion rings and a \"Michael Jackson.\"Drink: Lately it has been stinky, sometimes barnyard-y Italian reds. When I'm nervous, it's bloody marys. Any other time, gin and tonics or negronis.Party central: My home kitchen, late at night: friends, family meals, music, mabye ranting and raving over work or an episode of \"Top Chef,\" and a drink.Momentary style obsessions: Bow ties on my dogs; old lady jewelry; boots/tights/dresses - anything warm that feels like home.Reading material: Just started an off-the-beaten-track rotating book club with my mom and sis - I'm waiting for this month's book. In the meantime, \"The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City,\" by Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen.Art pick: Paula Wachsstock. She is my hero and my idol. No one and nothing is better than the world seen through her eyes on canvas.Museums: When it's warm, the Socrates Sculpture Park; when it's cold, the Whitney or the Guggenheim.Movies: \"Rocky\" I, II and III; \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.\" I watched them with my father and his best friend so often as a little girl. They still have the ability to make me laugh, make me cry and remind me of the simplest times in life for no reasons other than my own.Vacation destination: My lake house in southwest Maryland with the greatest people in the world - I never do so little, laugh so hard and have such a great time.Winter survival tip: Eat more than you should - summer is still months away; shamelessly love your winter hat (never take it off, wear it to bed!); wake up in the middle of the night during a snowfall and go for a walk on an unfettered side street - nothing is better and we all believe the city is ours alone.Something you are looking forward to this spring: Long walks late at night; fixing up the backyard; sundresses; bike rides.

I want to change my path, but I just can't. P.D.T. for a drink, a hot dog and good company. Tompkins Square Park for a midday breather in good weather. I goto stalk other dog owners and their dogs, I go to watch movies in thesummer, I go to lay on blankets on fall afternoons. Sunny & Annie's for the Chicago or the Bulgogi sandwich. I will wait allday and night, walk my cold, tired self blocks over, order my sandwich (buy some chips and ice cream and candy) and lay in bed with my booty. Mama's Bar for a beer. WD~50 for a hug, or some advice, or an ingredient, or a snack, or a drink, or a three-hour meal.

Reverend Armitstead was born on December 30, 1924 in Nashua, New Hampshire and spent his childhood and teenage years in New England and Pennsylvania before enlisting in the Army in early 1943. Armitstead fought for freedom as an infantryman in the 12th Armored Division seeing action along the Rhine River near Strausburg, France until taken as a prisoner of war in early 1945. After his liberation in April 1945 he returned to the United States and civilian life. He graduated Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in 1948 and having decided to dedicate his life to the service of God, worked with migrant farm workers from northern Florida through northern New York before enrolling in Union Theological Seminary in New York City where he was awarded a Masters of Divinity in 1952. He married his wife, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen in 1951 and the couple began a lifetime of ministry together. Reverend Armitstead was an elder in the New York Conference of the United Methodist Church and served pastorates in Hauppauge, Commack and Center Moriches on Long Island, Bay Ridge Methodist Church in Brooklyn, Faith United Methodist Church on Staten Island and Community United Methodist Church in Jackson Heights, Queens where he established a four language church bringing a diverse community together in service to God. Upon his retirement in 1994, he served as a Community Liaison for the Western Queens Gazette and offered his personal ministry through his photographic works. In addition to his pastoral responsibilities Armitstead was also a leader and advocate for social change and justice in each of his stops along life's path. He was an early and vocal advocate for racial integration and equality and also worked tirelessly in the cause of ecumenicalism and community responsibility upon the part of the churches he served. He held positions as President, Vice-President or Chairman on a number of boards in New York including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Police Community Relations, Staten Island Council of Churches, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home, Jackson Heights Community Development, sheltered New York City homeless, served the New York City Police and Fire Departments in a number of ways, and served on numerous task forces of New York City Mayors, improving the lives of thousands. His passion for championing the underdog was also evident in his life-long love of baseball as he was an avid New York Mets fan and attended nearly a thousand ball games at Shea Stadium in Queens. Perhaps fitting, Armitstead died only a few days after the last remaining piece of that ballpark was leveled. He was an honorary lifetime member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Due to declining health, Armitstead and his wife moved to Suffolk in the summer of 2007 where he lived out his life close to family. Reverend Armitstead is survived by his wife of over 57 years, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen Armitstead; one daughter, Nancy Armitstead of New York City; two sons, Alan Jackson Armitstead (wife, Petra) of Suffolk and John Auman Armitstead (wife, Ima) of Lexington, Kentucky; two brothers, Donald M. Armitstead of Seattle, WA and Dr. Paul T. Armitstead of Waco, TX; and five grandchildren, Christian, Jaclyn, Michael, Steven and Jonathan. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 27, at 11am in Sturtevant Funeral Home, Bennetts Creek Chapel, Suffolk celebrated by the Reverend Bob Weeks of Aldersgate United Methodist Church. Ground committal will be in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery also in Suffolk.

Reverend Armitstead was born on December 30, 1924 in Nashua, New Hampshire and spent his childhood and teenage years in New England and Pennsylvania before enlisting in the Army in early 1943. Armitstead fought for freedom as an infantryman in the 12th Armored Division seeing action along the Rhine River near Strausburg, France until taken as a prisoner of war in early 1945. After his liberation in April 1945 he returned to the United States and civilian life. He graduated Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in 1948 and having decided to dedicate his life to the service of God, worked with migrant farm workers from northern Florida through northern New York before enrolling in Union Theological Seminary in New York City where he was awarded a Masters of Divinity in 1952. He married his wife, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen in 1951 and the couple began a lifetime of ministry together. Reverend Armitstead was an elder in the New York Conference of the United Methodist Church and served pastorates in Hauppauge, Commack and Center Moriches on Long Island, Bay Ridge Methodist Church in Brooklyn, Faith United Methodist Church on Staten Island and Community United Methodist Church in Jackson Heights, Queens where he established a four language church bringing a diverse community together in service to God. Upon his retirement in 1994, he served as a Community Liaison for the Western Queens Gazette and offered his personal ministry through his photographic works. In addition to his pastoral responsibilities Armitstead was also a leader and advocate for social change and justice in each of his stops along life's path. He was an early and vocal advocate for racial integration and equality and also worked tirelessly in the cause of ecumenicalism and community responsibility upon the part of the churches he served. He held positions as President, Vice-President or Chairman on a number of boards in New York including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Police Community Relations, Staten Island Council of Churches, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home, Jackson Heights Community Development, sheltered New York City homeless, served the New York City Police and Fire Departments in a number of ways, and served on numerous task forces of New York City Mayors, improving the lives of thousands. His passion for championing the underdog was also evident in his life-long love of baseball as he was an avid New York Mets fan and attended nearly a thousand ball games at Shea Stadium in Queens. Perhaps fitting, Armitstead died only a few days after the last remaining piece of that ballpark was leveled. He was an honorary lifetime member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Due to declining health, Armitstead and his wife moved to Suffolk in the summer of 2007 where he lived out his life close to family. Reverend Armitstead is survived by his wife of over 57 years, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen Armitstead; one daughter, Nancy Armitstead of New York City; two sons, Alan Jackson Armitstead (wife, Petra) of Suffolk and John Auman Armitstead (wife, Ima) of Lexington, Kentucky; two brothers, Donald M. Armitstead of Seattle, WA and Dr. Paul T. Armitstead of Waco, TX; and five grandchildren, Christian, Jaclyn, Michael, Steven and Jonathan. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 27, at 11am in Sturtevant Funeral Home, Bennetts Creek Chapel, Suffolk celebrated by the Reverend Bob Weeks of Aldersgate United Methodist Church. Ground committal will be in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery also in Suffolk.

In my travels, I've often gone hundreds of miles out of my way to visit improbably tiny sovereign states, not knowing myself what it was that drew me to them, and usually regretting the detour. Andorra, that enigmatic republic in the Pyrenees, revealed itself to be a cluster of duty-free shops and dusty, neglected-looking hills; Monaco felt like a glorified suburb of Nice; and Vatican City, despite the pomp, seemed like little more than one of Rome's less charming neighborhoods. As with any obsession, however, disappointment only sharpened my desire. The impossible country of my imagination existed somewhere, I was sure of it: the fact that I hadn't been there yet was the best proof of its magical obscurity. What's more, I had a hunch as to this mysterious nation's location, and even as to what it might be called. I was reasonably sure its name was Liechtenstein. The principality of Liechtenstein, sandwiched between Switzerland and Austria, is one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world, meaning that all of its direct neighbors are landlocked as well. (The other is Uzbekistan.) It is the sixth-smallest nation in area, the seventh-smallest in population and the smallest in which German is spoken. Its citizens, just over 35,000 at last count, speak a wide variety of Alpine dialects, a number of which could be unintelligible to a visitor from Vienna or Hamburg or Munich. Simply getting to the principality is something of an adventure, both straightforward and strangely involved, as though someone -- the Swiss? the princely family? the I.R.S.? -- were trying to discourage the casual visitor. Liechtenstein has no airport, and the eminently comfortable and efficient train from Zurich stops on either side of the principality but not actually inside it. The last five miles require a bus, a taxi, a bicycle or possibly a donkey, of which there are surprisingly many in Liechtenstein. I opted for the bus, partly because it was simplest and partly to test the reliability of the country's renowned public transportation system.

The Moment caught up with the outrageous Ms. O to discuss her band's excellent -- and vastly different-sounding -- new album, \"It's Blitz,\" and also to discover her personal aesthetic and why she was voted \"Most Atypical\" in high school.Yeah Yeah Yeahs' new album, \"It's Blitz,\" has more of a 1980s sound than past albums, with synthesizers and traces of artists like Til Tuesday, Gary Numan and the Cocteau Twins. Was there a conscious decision to change the band's sound?It all happened pretty organically and spontaneously. There wasn't much intention to go in that direction, but after we wrote the first two songs, \"Zero\" [the new single] and \"Skeleton,\" which both incorporate that pulsating synth sound, it set the scene for the record.You recorded \"It's Blitz\" in a fairly remote part of West Texas. How did working there impact your creative process?Texas was amazing. On one hand, it was like a creative retreat, going to the studio every day in a place where we felt completely detached. But it was surreal having that amount of space in the desert and being surrounded by all these pecan trees -- there are miles and miles of pecan trees there. But it allowed us to dig in our heels and get back to our roots as a band.For the album artwork, which has a photograph on an egg being smashed by a hand, you enlisted Urs Fischer, the artist who made that huge crater at Gavin Brown Enterprises a few years back. How did you come to work with him?My friend Trztn was Urs's assistant and Urs did the cover for his band, Services, which I loved. It has a woman's eyelash with a wad of spit on it, which takes a second to figure out. It's pretty bold. I thought he would be great with a cover that reflected a sound like nothing we had ever recorded before.In interviews you've name-checked the Dadaist and Surrealist movements as influences. Are they a big part of your aesthetic sensibility?I like humor, and Dada and surreality are part of my expression, as is emotional honesty, not taking some things so seriously, and revealing the absurdity of things. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation,but that sensibility matches a big part of me.On stage you can seem maniacal. It's kind of like Iggy Pop's approach to live performance. Where does your wild abandon come from?I got turned onto Iggy late in the game. If anything, it was where I grew up in New Jersey, in Engelwood and Cresskill. I had a ton of angst. I was an outsider. In my high school, you know the senior poll with people getting \"Best Legs\" or \"Best Smile\"? I got \"Most Atypical.\"Since the beginning of YYY's, you've collaborated with the designer Christian Joy, whose costumes are wild and campy. Yet they seem to complement your stage persona.Her designs complete me as a performer, a musician and a rocker -- I guess that's the best way to describe it. To a certain extent the costumes she makes me are a challenge that I have to live up to and work out. Do you design the clothes with her?We'll talk about general broad concepts, but in the end she'll do what she wants to do.What's your wardrobe like? Do you have lots of designer clothes?Thinking about my closets reminds me of the spring cleaning I desperately need to do. I love vintage and mixing it with my can't-live-without day-to-day pieces. More than anything I'm a vintage girl. In the new video for \"Zero,\" you're wearing a \"Karen O\" leather jacket.

The Democratic Party is enjoying a resurgence in Virginia, propelled first by the November victory of Barack Obama -- the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Lyndon Johnson -- and now by a lively battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. There are three men who want the nomination, but on this weekend, you could be forgiven for thinking that there was only one, and that his name was Terry McAuliffe. There were McAuliffe signs everywhere, an exhausting blur of blue and yellow starting at the airport and rolling for nine miles to the entrance of the Greater Richmond Convention Center. There, bustling McAuliffe campaign workers, rolling around on electric carts, hoisted a McAuliffe for Governor banner over the street. A marching band stepped in place, before accompanying McAuliffe and his supporters as they paraded around the center, grandly announcing his arrival. Inside, volunteers scattered the hall with 2,500 McAuliffe fortune cookies, which crumbled open to reveal fortunes like high speed rail is in your future. The fortune-cookie count came courtesy of the McAuliffe campaign, which also reported that the campaign had purchased 39 dinner tables, printed 1,000 McAuliffe for Governor signs, issued 300 glow sticks to wave at the dinner and was paying for two after-dinner parties, with open bars. It was a display of political money and muscle that was quite unlike anything anyone had ever seen at the annual dinner.

One might say this was doubly imprudent of him: the attack was already disclosing itself as a debacle, and Fairlie himself was on the run from the law, first as a bankrupt and then (having failed to attend his own bankruptcy hearing) as a man cited for contempt of court. His radio appearance made it easy for the authorities to pinpoint his whereabouts, and he was soon in Brixton prison. Asked for her reaction, his long-suffering wife plaintively but memorably said, ''At least I know where he is tonight.'' Nobody who knew Henry even slightly (and I must here confess that I knew him reasonably well in Washington in the mid-1980s) would fail to see in this an encapsulation of the man and the style. The word ''raffish'' might have been coined for him. In the introduction to BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU: Essays and Provocations (New Republic/Yale University, $30), an anthology of Fairlie's writings, the editor, Jeremy McCarter, says that ''even in the louche world of Fleet Street, where every vice found a champion, he distinguished himself: he drank; his finances were a crime against responsibility; his charm and darkly handsome looks availed him of endless affairs.''

It was all the more stunning because we had watched his childhood and adolescence. He wasn't an apparition rising out of obscurity, like Elvis Presley. To become who he was in ''Off the Wall,'' he had to annul -- if not destroy -- the performer he had been in the Jackson 5. And yet the change was organic as well as deliberate. Michael Jackson grew into his body, and out of that new body emerged a wholly new idea of what pop music, and the movement it generates, might be. It can be hard to remember now, 30 years later, just how ubiquitous the hits from that album, especially ''Rock With You,'' really were. In soul, in rock 'n' roll, and in pop, there is a long tradition of men singing in high voices, the height of the voice suggesting the pitch of the singer's fervor. Michael Jackson made the sweetness of that high voice guttural and demanding. He showed that it was rooted in his feet and hips and hands.

The singalongs were high-pitched and loud for No Doubt and the punk-pop band Paramore, which have been touring together. Their opening act for this part of the tour, Janelle Monáe, had style and energy to match them both. In solidarity they shared an encore, with Gwen Stefani from No Doubt, Hayley Williams from Paramore and Ms. Monáe each belting verses of Adam Ant's ''Stand and Deliver.'' No Doubt regrouped in 2008 to work on its first full album since ''Rock Steady'' in 2001. During the break Ms. Stefani made hits as a solo act and had children. The band started the new album, then decided to seek inspiration by touring. If it has new songs, it wasn't revealing them. The set ran through No Doubt's singles, which were mostly played like their recorded versions except for ''Excuse Me Mr.,'' which was transformed from punk to Police-like reggae. The tour postpones the question No Doubt was asking itself as early as its 2000 album, ''Return of Saturn'': What does a band that got together in Southern California's bratty 1980s ska-revival scene have to say as a group of grown-ups?", "headline" : { "main" : "The Headliner Did Push-Ups, and Other Strong Sister Acts", "kicker" : "MUSIC REVIEW | NO DOUBT" }, "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "1", "word_count" : 570, "snippet" : "Female empowerment and show-business savvy converged when No Doubt headlined a triple bill with Paramore and Janelle Monáe.", "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/arts/music/29doubt.html", "multimedia" : [ { "url" : "images/2009/06/28/arts/Doubt75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/06/28/arts/Doubt75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "subtype" : "xlarge", "url" : "images/2009/06/28/arts/Doubt600.jpg", "height" : 400, "width" : 600, "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "hasxlarge" : "Y", "xlarge" : "images/2009/06/28/arts/Doubt600.jpg", "xlargeheight" : 400 }, "type" : "image" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "keywords" : [ { "name" : "persons", "value" : "MONAE, JANELLE" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "STEFANI, GWEN" }, { "name" : "organizations", "value" : "NO DOUBT" }, { "name" : "organizations", "value" : "PARAMORE" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "MUSIC" } ], "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "rank" : 1, "firstname" : "Jon", "lastname" : "PARELES" } ], "original" : "By JON PARELES" }, "document_type" : "article", "pub_date" : "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name" : "Arts" }

A candidate comes into office brandishing a broad theme -- a vow to clean up government, perhaps, or to fearlessly prune it back -- and then lays out one or two big proposals to make it real. In time, of course, a presidency tends to sprawl as events intrude. Bill Clinton couldn't have imagined he would spend so much of his two terms fending off resurgent Republicans, just as George W. Bush didn't envision going to war. But at least for those first several months, while the White House controls its own fate, the presidency is supposed to unfold in discrete chapters, each building atop the last. Both Ronald Reagan and Bush began with an almost single-minded push for tax cuts during their opening months, while Clinton opened with an economic program and then a monthslong drive for health care reform. The simple premise here is that every new presidency is a story; the more muddled and erratic the storyline, the harder it is for the public to follow along and the less likely the chances of reaching a satisfying end. Barack Obama is a born storyteller, which makes it all the more confounding that as president he refuses to inhabit a neat political narrative. Obama's themes are clear enough (salvaging the American economy, reversing the Bush years), but his legislative priorities seem to rotate in and out like so many suitcases on a conveyor belt. One day his presidency hinges on health care, then he's lobbying for a cap-and-trade plan to reduce carbon emissions and then he's out there trying to re-regulate the financial world or sell a new treaty with the Russians. ''An administration about everything is an administration about nothing'' is the way the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan put it in The Wall Street Journal. Colin Powell made a similar point, telling John King of CNN, ''I think one of the cautions that has to be given to the president -- and I've talked to some of his people about this -- is that you can't have so many things on the table that you can't absorb it all.''", "headline" : { "main" : "The Shuffle President", "kicker" : "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW" }, "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "11", "word_count" : 1042, "snippet" : "Barack Obama’s complicated, even eclectic, agenda suits our multitasking digital age.", "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19fob-wwln-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "url" : "images/2009/07/19/magazine/19lede-75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/07/19/magazine/19lede-75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "subtype" : "xlarge", "url" : "images/2009/07/19/magazine/19lede-600.jpg", "height" : 388, "width" : 600, "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "hasxlarge" : "Y", "xlarge" : "images/2009/07/19/magazine/19lede-600.jpg", "xlargeheight" : 388 }, "type" : "image" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "keywords" : [ { "name" : "persons", "value" : "OBAMA, BARACK" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "UNITED STATES ECONOMY" } ], "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "rank" : 1, "firstname" : "Matt", "lastname" : "BAI" } ], "original" : "By MATT BAI" }, "document_type" : "article", "pub_date" : "2009-07-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name" : "Health; Magazine; Washington" }

This talented artist is a sensitive man, warm, funny and full of insight''), but Davis, who wallowed in rock 'n' roll depravity in his best-selling Led Zeppelin biography ''Hammer of the Gods,'' apparently feels no obligation to praise his own contribution to sentences like ''The price of fame can be a heavy one'' and ''My chimp Bubbles is a constant delight.''

JACKSON: Ian Halperin's ''Unmasked: The Final Years of Michael Jackson'' falls to No. 3 in its second week on the list. Here's one juicy tidbit Halperin missed: Patricia Highsmith was a big Jackson fan -- sort of. The author of ''Strangers on a Train'' and ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' may have preferred Mozart and classic show tunes to Motown and schmaltzy Paul McCartney duets, but she did toy with the idea of writing a story about ''someone like Michael Jackson,'' Joan Schenkar, the author of the forthcoming biography ''The Talented Miss Highsmith,'' wrote last month at the Web site Head Butler. In December 1984, just after the height of ''Thriller''-mania (and before Jackson's long downward slide), Highsmith sat at her desk in a gloomy Swiss village and wrote the following notes: ''A type like Michael Jackson, in love with himself. Sterling image to the public. Schizo finally. He talks to himself. . . . Friends are aware of this -- but the boy is a moneymaker.'' EAT, PRAY, AVENGE: Elizabeth Gilbert's ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' No. 12 in its 130th week on the paperback nonfiction list, has won over millions of women with the argument that traveling, eating and meditating well is the best revenge. Turnabout is fair play, and now Gilbert's former husband, Michael Cooper, has signed a deal to write a book chronicling his side of their breakup and his own ''search for purpose'' in the Middle East and beyond. It's called ''Displaced,'' and it's due out in 2010, which will probably be too soon to complain about the casting of the film version of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' which is slated to star Javier Bardem as the Latin lover Gilbert meets in Bali. In an enthusiastic review of Gilbert's book in The Washington Post, Grace Lichtenstein envisioned it as a perfect vehicle for Jennifer Aniston, another ''plucky blond American woman in her thirties with no children and no major money worries'' on the rebound from a bad divorce.

Hasselbeck had back trouble last season and played in only seven games, and his receiving corps needed a MASH unit. Hasselbeck is back, and he can throw the ball to T. J. Houshmandzadeh, the most talented receiver he has ever had. Other than injuries, the problem last year -- and potentially this year -- is the defense. It was terrible in 2008, particularly against the pass, not a good thing when you are in the same division as Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald. End Patrick Kerney is returning from an elbow injury, which should help the pass rush. The Seahawks owned this division until half the team went on injured reserve last season. If their health holds up, they should overtake the Cardinals. One thing working against the Arizona Cardinals: for a Super Bowl runner-up, they had an unusual amount of off-season tumult. Both coordinators are gone to the Kansas City Chiefs. Anquan Boldin spent the off-season upset about his contract. And Warner got a few months older. Todd Haley left to become the Chiefs' head coach, but the offense he left behind is incredible, particularly the other-worldly Fitzgerald. If Fitzgerald plays during the regular season anything like the way he did when he took over the playoffs, the Cardinals' offense cannot be stopped. Unless Warner gets hurt. The good news is the Cardinals filled a gaping need when they drafted Chris Wells, a hulking running back who can provide the ground game that was absent last season.

In flashbacks more than 40 years earlier, Lee Ingleby plays George Bennett, a high-level police official whose career took off with the case and who is now the subject of Catherine's latest documentary. Philip Jackson is George as an older man. Greg Wise, above with Ms. Stevenson, plays the girl's arrogant stepfather; Tony Maudsley is George's garrulous sergeant; and Elizabeth Day is Catherine's rebel daughter, who can't stand her mother but is fascinated by her project. Then there are the suspects: a schoolmate (Mikey North) who had secretly kept photographs of the victim, and the victim's uncle (Ryan Anthony-Jones), a known sexual offender. But most troubling are the local villagers, who for more than four decades have withheld information.

''The Men Who Stare at Goats,'' a comedy from Overture Films starring George Clooney and Jeff Bridges, was third with about $13 million. Two horror movies rounded out the Top 5: ''The Fourth Kind'' (Universal) earned about $12.5 million while ''Paranormal Activity'' (Paramount) drew about $9 million (for about $97 million so far).

She was plucked from obscurity in the village of Blackburn in Scotland and catapulted to stardom -- with a few bumps along the way -- after performing on ''Britain's Got Talent,'' for which Mr. Morgan, along with Simon Cowell and Amanda Holden, is a judge.
