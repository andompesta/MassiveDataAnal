Lately, however, since coming ''out of the closet as far as global warming is concerned,'' as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors' letter boxes and Dyson's own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described as ''a pompous twit,'' ''a blowhard,'' ''a cesspool of misinformation,'' ''an old coot riding into the sunset'' and, perhaps inevitably, ''a mad scientist.'' Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the mass cultivation of specially bred ''carbon-eating trees,'' whereupon the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded -- there are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford -- and suggested that ''perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can give directions to lost hikers.'' Dyson's son, George, a technology historian, says his father's views have cooled friendships, while many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else. There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the 20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone -- out of his beautiful mind. But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, Dyson's friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the case. ''His mind is still so open and flexible,'' Sacks says. Which makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose intelligence is revered by other scientists -- William Press, former deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him ''infinitely smart.'' Dyson -- a mathematics prodigy who came to this country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory -- not only did path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Witten, the ''high priest of string theory'' whose office at the institute is just across the hall from Dyson's. Yet instead of hewing to that fundamental field, Dyson chose to pursue broader and more unusual pursuits than most physicists -- and has lived a more original life.", "headline" : { "main" : "The Civil Heretic" }, "pub_date" : "2009-03-29T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "32", "word_count" : 8217, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "width" : 600, "url" : "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "height" : 400, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "xlargeheight" : 400, "xlarge" : "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "persons", "value" : "HANSEN, JAMES V" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "SACKS, OLIVER" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "DYSON, FREEMAN J" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "GORE, AL" }, { "name" : "organizations", "value" : "PRINCETON UNIVERSITY" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "GLOBAL WARMING" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "firstname" : "Nicholas", "rank" : 1, "lastname" : "DAWIDOFF" } ], "original" : "By NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF" }, "section_name" : "Technology; Science; Magazine" }

''It was years ago,'' Seidel explained in his measured voice, ''in the days when I had an answering machine. I'd left my apartment, briefly, to go outside to get something, and when I came back there was a message. When I played it, there was a woman's voice, a young woman's voice sounding deeply aroused, saying: 'Frederick Seidel . . . Frederick Seidel . . . you think you're going to live. You think you're going to live. But you're not. You're not going to live. You're not going to live. . . .' All this extraordinary, suggestive heavy breathing, getting, in the tone of it, more and more intensely sexual, more gruesome, and then this sort of explosion of sound from this woman, and: 'You're . . . not . . . going . . . to . . . live.' '' Seidel paused. The bright cries of a group of young women giving a baby shower in the adjoining booth rose and fell behind the bare crown of Seidel's gray head. ''So,'' he continued, ''the first thing I did was call a girlfriend. And the woman said, 'I'm coming over.' And did. And listened to this thing. And burst into tears. Because it really was horrific.'' Another friend, a federal judge, also listened, insisting that Seidel call the police immediately and tell them he'd received a death threat. ''They came by and they said: 'It's real. Have you published a book recently?' I had. And that was it, really. Meaning nothing happened. But,'' Seidel said, his large blue eyes brightening, ''it was the most severe review I've ever received.''", "headline" : { "main" : "Laureate of the Louche" }, "pub_date" : "2009-04-12T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "25", "word_count" : 5322, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/magazine/12Seidel-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "credit" : "Frederick Seidel reads poems from his collected works.", "url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/04/12/magazine/20090412-seidelpoetry-audioss/index.html", "width" : 680, "rank" : "1", "height" : 583, "caption" : "Spoken Word", "legacy" : { "MultimediaPopupHeight1" : "583", "MultimediaType1" : "AudioSS", "MultimediaPopupWidth1" : "680", "MultimediaUrl1" : "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/04/12/magazine/20090412-seidelpoetry-audioss/index.html", "MultimediaSummary1" : "Frederick Seidel reads poems from his collected works.", "MultimediaHeadline1" : "Spoken Word", "MultimediaCol1" : "Magazine" }, "type" : "AudioSS", "col" : "Magazine" }, { "url" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "width" : 600, "url" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-600.jpg", "height" : 394, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "xlargeheight" : 394, "xlarge" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-600.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" }, { "width" : 337, "url" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-337.jpg", "height" : 250, "subtype" : "tiny_thumb", "legacy" : { "tinythumbwidth" : 337, "tinythumbheight" : 250, "tinythumb" : "images/2009/04/12/magazine/12seidel-337.jpg", "hastinythumb" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "persons", "value" : "SEIDEL, FREDERICK" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "POETRY AND POETS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "WRITING AND WRITERS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "BOOKS AND LITERATURE" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "firstname" : "Wyatt", "rank" : 1, "lastname" : "MASON" } ], "original" : "By WYATT MASON" }, "section_name" : "Magazine; Books" }

Dick of Armonk, NY, passed away early Sunday morning (April 19, 2009) at Northern Westchester Hospital after a protracted illness. Born May 14, 1924, in New Haven, CT, to Morris and Beatrice, he graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1945; A.M., 1951); Yale Law School (LL.B., 1950); Harvard University (Ph.D., 1956). Dick studied Japanese while serving his country in WWII. While working on his doctoral degree in Japan, he became one of a handful of foreign lawyers ever admitted to the Japanese Bar, and was admitted to the Korean Bar as well. He practiced law in Tokyo for more than 35 years as a founding partner of what was then the largest and most well-known firm in Japan, Anderson Mori & Rabinowitz. He returned to the United States in 1991, teaching at Harvard and Yale Law Schools. From 1995 until his death, he was Of Counsel to Tozai Sogo Law Office, also of Tokyo, Japan. A lover of Jazz since his early days at University, Dick wept when listening to Billie Holiday, and had great reverence for Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, who, as he explained, got him through many late night study sessions. A high school ice hockey goalie, his devotion to the sport only intensified with age. It was not uncommon for him to schedule his work and naps around what game was on, and was loyal to the game, not a team. Dick is survived by his wife of 57 years, Janice Hope Rabinowitz (Rosenbaum), and their three children, Ann Akiko Rabinowitz Dantzig (Armonk, NY) and her longtime partner John Diacnois, John Makoto Rabinowitz (Benicia, CA) and his wife Loan, Anthony Carl Rabinowitz (South Lake Tahoe, CA) and his wife Lisa, two granddaughters Natasha Chieko and Alexia Haruko Dantzig, and John's children Ari and Alix Diaconis Contributions in Dick's memory may be made in the United States to the Ken Hamilton Caregivers Center, Northern Westchester Hospital Center, 400 East Main Street, Mt.

Dick of Armonk, NY, passed away early Sunday morning (April 19, 2009) at Northern Westchester Hospital after a protracted illness. Born May 14, 1924, in New Haven, CT, to Morris and Beatrice, he graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1945; A.M., 1951); Yale Law School (LL.B., 1950); Harvard University (Ph.D., 1956). Dick studied Japanese while serving his country in WWII. While working on his doctoral degree in Japan, he became one of a handful of foreign lawyers ever admitted to the Japanese Bar, and was admitted to the Korean Bar as well. He practiced law in Tokyo for more than 35 years as a founding partner of what was then the largest and most well-known firm in Japan, Anderson Mori & Rabinowitz. He returned to the United States in 1991, teaching at Harvard and Yale Law Schools. From 1995 until his death, he was Of Counsel to Tozai Sogo Law Office, also of Tokyo, Japan. A lover of Jazz since his early days at University, Dick wept when listening to Billie Holiday, and had great reverence for Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, who, as he explained, got him through many late night study sessions. A high school ice hockey goalie, his devotion to the sport only intensified with age. It was not uncommon for him to schedule his work and naps around what game was on, and was loyal to the game, not a team. Dick is survived by his wife of 57 years, Janice Hope Rabinowitz (Rosenbaum), and their three children, Ann Akiko Rabinowitz Dantzig (Armonk, NY) and her longtime partner John Diacnois, John Makoto Rabinowitz (Benicia, CA) and his wife Loan, Anthony Carl Rabinowitz (South Lake Tahoe, CA) and his wife Lisa, two granddaughters Natasha Chieko and Alexia Haruko Dantzig, and John's children Ari and Alix Diaconis Contributions in Dick's memory may be made in the United States to the Ken Hamilton Caregivers Center, Northern Westchester Hospital Center, 400 East Main Street, Mt.

Nasheed appeared when a pair of French doors opened and a gust of conversation blew into the room. It was a humid night in March. Several dozen cabinet members, Supreme Court justices, parliamentarians, presidential advisers and other dignitaries trailed the young president, who wore navy slacks and a striped white shirt, open at the neck and sleeves rolled to the elbows. He took a seat in the front row, the lights dimmed and the British feature documentary ''The Age of Stupid'' began.", "headline" : { "main" : "Wanted: A New Home for My Country" }, "pub_date" : "2009-05-10T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "38", "word_count" : 4843, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/magazine/10MALDIVES-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "url" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives-75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives-75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "width" : 500, "url" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives-500.jpg", "height" : 500, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 500, "xlargeheight" : 500, "xlarge" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives-500.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" }, { "width" : 337, "url" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives.2-395.jpg", "height" : 250, "subtype" : "tiny_thumb", "legacy" : { "tinythumbwidth" : 337, "tinythumbheight" : 250, "tinythumb" : "images/2009/05/10/magazine/10maldives.2-395.jpg", "hastinythumb" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "glocations", "value" : "MALDIVES" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "GLOBAL WARMING" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "firstname" : "Nicholas", "rank" : 1, "lastname" : "SCHMIDLE" } ], "original" : "By NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE" }, "section_name" : "Magazine" }

Since then they had rallied most of the biggest pop stars in the Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking worlds; held enormous concerts in Mexico and Argentina; gained the philanthropic support of some of Latin America's richest families (as well as Warren Buffett's son Howard); and captured the attention of a good number of heads of state.

Graduate of Washington Irving High School, student at the Arts Students League, studied with Lee Strausberg, and received her B.A., magna cum laude, from NYU. After success as an actress in Street Car Named Desire, Ice Man Cometh, Trojan Woman, and Restoration Comedies, she returned to undergraduate school at age 35, had solo art shows and built a reputation as a fine artist. Her work is included in books about sculpture in light and plastic. She taught art at Ethical Culture School in Manhattan. A student of TM, she studied with Marharishi Mahesh Yogi. Her gift of clairvoyance led her to help many to read their pasts as a tool to light their present dilemmas. She deeply touched many lives. All who met her felt her luminescence.

Struck suddenly by Adenocarcinoma, she courageously battled the disease on her own terms in her own home. She was a woman of many talents: actress, painter, watercolorist, sculptor, teacher, and psychic. Graduate of Washington Irving High School, student at the Arts Students League, studied with Lee Strausberg, and received her B.A., magna cum laude, from NYU. After success as an actress in Street Car Named Desire, Ice Man Cometh, Trojan Woman, and Restoration Comedies, she returned to undergraduate school at age 35, had solo art shows and built a reputation as a fine artist. Her work is included in books about sculpture in light and plastic. She taught art at Ethical Culture School in Manhattan. A student of TM, she studied with Marharishi Mahesh Yogi. Her gift of clairvoyance led her to help many to read their pasts as a tool to light their present dilemmas. She deeply touched many lives. All who met her felt her luminescence. She is survived by her son, Marc Vandermeer, her daughter-in-law Leslie Vandermeer, two grandchildren, Sarah and Miles, a sister Ruth Kaplan, and lifelong friend Richard Fabrizio. She will be deeply missed by her family and many friends.

Once the program was open, I tried to log on with the screen name my 18-year-old son, Dan, had shown me on a different site called PokerStars. Full Tilt Poker, unsurprisingly, rejected the name. Following the plan I outlined as I lay awake in the wee hours, I opened up Dan's college e-mail account. Weeks before, he read his e-mail via my computer and asked Firefox to save the password. I clicked ''Enter.'' There before me were all the e-mail messages from university officials, from his tennis coach, from teachers. Most prevalent were e-mail messages from Full Tilt Poker, addressed to a screen name I did not recognize. Grimly satisfied, I read none of these. I simply returned to Full Tilt, entered the screen name from the e-mail and clicked ''Forgot my password.'' I expected the program to ask me the name of my favorite rock band, at which point my foray into the role of Internet spy would cease. To my surprise, the window on the screen read, ''We have sent your new password to the e-mail address on record.''

Some of the more ambitious dishes, like the duck or the mousse, were pointed toward weekend company, but my mother would usually test these out on me and my sisters earlier in the week, and a few of the others -- including the boeuf bourguignon, which I especially loved -- actually made it into heavy weeknight rotation.

He was referring to ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' a big-budget adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic picture book for children. According to Faraci, executives at Warner Brothers had deemed an early cut of the film ''too weird and 'too scary' '' and were now contemplating extensive personnel changes and reshoots. The news rippled through Hollywood's online underground. At Slashfilm.com, it generated 88 reader responses. At Firstshowing.net, another 25. Some readers pleaded with the studio: ''Please please please follow through with the original.'' Others took a more authoritative tone: ''Do not turn 'Where the Wild Things Are' into something common and forgettable!'' There were calls for fan solidarity and several threats of boycott, or worse: ''I will personally face-punch anyone who stands in the way of this film being released.'' Such variations aside, though, a common theme emerged: ''Jonze is brilliant''; ''Jonze is an artist''; ''Trust Jonze!''", "headline" : { "main" : "Wild Life" }, "pub_date" : "2009-09-06T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "30", "word_count" : 7565, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "credit" : "Footage from \"Tell Them Anything You Want,\" a coming HBO documentary about Maurice Sendak directed by Lance Bangs and Spike Jonze, which airs on October 14.", "url" : "http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/09/02/magazine/1247464354702/you-make-my-heart-sing.html", "rank" : "1", "caption" : "You Make My Heart Sing", "legacy" : { "MultimediaHeadline1" : "You Make My Heart Sing", "MultimediaUrl1" : "http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/09/02/magazine/1247464354702/you-make-my-heart-sing.html", "MultimediaCol1" : "MAGAZINE", "MultimediaType1" : "Video", "MultimediaSummary1" : "Footage from \"Tell Them Anything You Want,\" a coming HBO documentary about Maurice Sendak directed by Lance Bangs and Spike Jonze, which airs on October 14." }, "type" : "Video", "col" : "MAGAZINE" }, { "url" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze.75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze.75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "width" : 600, "url" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze-600.jpg", "height" : 369, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "xlargeheight" : 369, "xlarge" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze-600.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" }, { "width" : 337, "url" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze.2-337.jpg", "height" : 250, "subtype" : "tiny_thumb", "legacy" : { "tinythumbwidth" : 337, "tinythumbheight" : 250, "tinythumb" : "images/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze.2-337.jpg", "hastinythumb" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "creative_works", "value" : "WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (MOVIE)" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "SENDAK, MAURICE" }, { "name" : "persons", "value" : "JONZE, SPIKE" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "MOVIES" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "WRITING AND WRITERS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "BOOKS AND LITERATURE" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "firstname" : "Saki", "rank" : 1, "lastname" : "KNAFO" } ], "original" : "By SAKI KNAFO" }, "section_name" : "Movies; Magazine; Books" }

Eventually, though, Baker bares his fangs: the book is the harshest, most serrated satire of the Iraq war yet published. These forces are ''special'' as in ''Mama says I'm special'' -- the unstoppable American soldier Zone is severely autistic, which is why he's so good at following orders. And the story's plot, it gradually becomes clear, proceeds from the premise that every lie the Bush administration told about the war was true. So terrorists declare, ''We hate your freedom''; felons forced into military service become brave tactical geniuses who wouldn't dream of hurting children; and Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are not only real but concealed in an oil refinery, where Americans would never think to look because of course the war wasn't about oil. The style and tone of Gabrielle Bell's comics are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Baker's -- flat, dry and understated -- but they allow her, too, to get away with just about anything. The brief title piece of her collection CECIL AND JORDAN IN NEW YORK: Stories (Drawn & Quarterly, $19.95) is narrated by a young woman who's just moved to the city with her filmmaker boyfriend; it's a clear-cut tale of impecunious 20-something artists until halfway through, when the narrator abruptly transforms herself into a chair, gets taken home by someone who finds her on the sidewalk and decides that her old life won't miss her.
