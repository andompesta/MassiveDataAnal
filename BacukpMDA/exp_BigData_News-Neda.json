Six days had passed since Iran's disputed June 12 election, but the fury that brought three million people onto the streets the previous Monday showed no sign of abating. ''Silence will win against bullets,'' a woman beside me whispered. Her name was Zahra. She wore a green headband -- the color adopted by the campaign of the defeated reformist candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi -- and she held a banner saying, ''This land is my land.'' The words captured the popular conviction that not only had President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stolen votes, but he also had made off with Iran's dignity. Slowly the vast crowd began to move north. No chant issued from the throng, only distilled indignation. A young man asked me where I was from. When I told him New York, he shot back: ''Give our regards to freedom. It's coming right here!'' In those giddy postelectoral days, anything seemed possible, even the arrival of liberty, or at least more of it, in the 30-year-old Islamic Republic. Through the swirl of events -- the huge crowds, the beatings and the sirens, the tear gas and black smoke -- the core issues were simple. Iranians felt cheated. They wanted their votes to count. They knew that no genuine victor with two-thirds of the vote need resort to brutality or fear a recount. Sometimes they asked me if the United Nations would help them; often they asked if America would. It was their way of saying, with fierce emotion, that the morality of the Iranian story, its right and wrong, was plain.", "headline" : { "main" : "The Making of an Iran Policy" }, "pub_date" : "2009-08-02T00:00:00Z", "abstract" : null, "print_page" : "36", "word_count" : 5634, "blog" : [], "source" : "The New York Times", "web_url" : "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/magazine/02Iran-t.html", "multimedia" : [ { "url" : "images/2009/08/02/magazine/02iran-75.jpg", "subtype" : "thumbnail", "legacy" : { "hasthumbnail" : "Y", "thumbnailheight" : 75, "thumbnail" : "images/2009/08/02/magazine/02iran-75.jpg" }, "type" : "image", "height" : 75 }, { "width" : 600, "url" : "images/2009/08/02/magazine/02iran-600.jpg", "height" : 359, "subtype" : "xlarge", "legacy" : { "xlargewidth" : 600, "xlargeheight" : 359, "xlarge" : "images/2009/08/02/magazine/02iran-600.jpg", "hasxlarge" : "Y" }, "type" : "image" } ], "keywords" : [ { "name" : "persons", "value" : "OBAMA, BARACK" }, { "name" : "glocations", "value" : "IRAN" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS" }, { "name" : "subject", "value" : "INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS" } ], "subsection_name" : null, "document_type" : "article", "byline" : { "person" : [ { "organization" : "", "role" : "reported", "firstname" : "Roger", "rank" : 1, "lastname" : "COHEN" } ], "original" : "By ROGER COHEN" }, "section_name" : "Magazine; Washington" }
