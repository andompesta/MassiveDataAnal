\begin{abstract}
In this report we consider the task of extracting a summary of the main event
that caused a shift on the opinion of Twitter users. This paper presents
several techniques which can be used to analyze these \emph{sentiment shift}
and to find the event which caused them. For each technique presented below
some aspects are taken in account, which are important in the context of a data
mining application, such as scalability and efficiency. A comparison of the
different techniques is shown as well.\end{abstract}   

\section{Introduction}
This work aims to find a summary of the events which caused a \emph{sentiment shift}. 

While event extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are mature,
their performance on tweets inevitably degrades due to the inherent sparsity in
short texts.  Since tweets contain heterogeneous language structures and are at
most 140 characters long, to extract event from tweets is quite tricky: instead
linking tweet to news articles allows us to extract data from well structured
and longer text than tweets.

%Due to the fact that our dataset is composed by labelled tweets, we manage to extract news from the New York Times archive basing the research on tweet's label. Starting form a good Tweet-News classification, allowed us to correlate tweet and news that belong to the same macro-topics avoiding to correlate object of different arguments.

Moreover NLP document compression techniques usually exploits language
dependent methods, whereas we want a methodology as language independent as
possible. 

This paper is structured as follows: in the next chapter we present some works
which are somehow related with the problem we are addressing, then we present a more
formal definition of our problem and some techniques which might be
used to solve it. The techniques which will be later discussed are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a technique exploiting the \emph{SpaceSaving} algorithm presented in
		\cite{SS};
	\item a technique exploiting \emph{Latent Semantic Indexing} \cite{LSA};
	\item the third one based on the popular \emph{Tf/Idf};
	\item the last (but not least) which take advantage of ngram graphs
		\cite{Ngram}
\end{itemize}
We will discuss each of these showing their advantages and
disadvantages, their efficiency and scalability issues. In addition, we will
show experimental results in order to compare their results and performances.
At the end of the paper we will present
some conclusions and draw some suggestions on how this work may be extended.
