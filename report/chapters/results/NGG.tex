	{\textbf{Result:} CERN said the latest incident was minor and did not affect attempts to restart the accelerator later this month following repairs.
	
'The bird escaped unharmed but lost its bread,'CERN said in a statement.

Bits of a French loaf dropped on an external electrical power supply caused a short circuit last week, triggering failsafe devices that shut down part of the cooling system of the giant experiment to probe the secrets of the universe.

The bird was believed to be an owl.

{\textbf{Result:}  Physicists and engineers have spent the past year testing and making repairs.

The physicists announced that they had succeeded in making the beams collide, producing what they called “candidate collision events” in the giant particle detectors in the collider.

Early next year the first runs devoted to physics research will start at 3.5 trillion electron volts — half the original design energy.

Those first collisions will occur at the so-called injection energy of 450 billion electron volts.

But the most important scientific results from the collider are still far in the future, scientists said.

{\textbf{Result:} Sixteen people injured in the massacre remain in hospital.

But until investigations are complete, no one can begin to imagine what could possibly have motivated this latest appalling rampage.

Poignant details released of each of those killed in the rampage have driven home the scale of the tragedy.

US authorities are investigating whether Major Hasan had any links to terrorist organisations.

The shooting has raised delicate questions about Muslim soldiers serving in the military, with Islamic groups calling for calm amid concerns of a backlash.

In other words, the multiplex really rocks when movies are served up the McDonalds way: predictably and comfortably.

People complain about Hollywood's tendency to be unadventurous with its big-money titles, but the moviegoing masses clearly get the most excited when they are not being surprised.

The good Transformers join forces with human armies to stop them.

''Transformers,'' which cost well over \$200 million to make and market, added electricity to the summer box office, which has slowed down a bit following a robust spring.

Those are just people lining up to see ‘The Hangover.

{\textbf{Result:} The news of Michael Jackson's untimely death rocked Twitter as fans of the pop music star sought the latest information and posted their reactions to the news.

Twitter subsequently announced Thursday that said it had disabled the search field on users' home pages entirely.

Shortly after TMZ, a news entertainment site, published a report around 5 p.m. stating that Mr. Jackson had died after suffering a heart attack.

''We saw more than double the normal tweets per second the moment the news broke—the biggest increase since the US presidential election (and Twitter has grown tremendously since then),''

{\textbf{Result:} Other sedatives including lorazepam contributed to the singer's death.

It said the full coroner's report and a complete toxicology report were being withheld at the request of the police  and the district attorney's office, whose investigation continues.

Medical experts say that if a patient receiving it is not carefully monitored with instruments that measure oxygen levels, blood pressure and heart rate, it can quickly cause problem.

Benzodiazepines also slow breathing, and Mr. Jackson was given three different benzodiazepines in the six hours before receiving propofol, according to court documents.

The coroner said the cause of death was acute intoxication from propofol, an anesthetic.
