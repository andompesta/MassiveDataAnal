{\textbf{Result:}  The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) says two beams of protons circulating simultaneously led to collisions at least four times during the afternoon and evening.
CERN’s director, Rolf Heuer, said in a statement, “It’s great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,” but he and others cautioned that there was a long way to go before the collider started producing the physics it was designed for\ldots

{\textbf{Result:} This signals that the killings at Fort Hood are seen less as part of the ongoing conflict between America and the Muslim world, or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more as part of a larger context of violent crime in the United States.

{\textbf{Result:} In my conversations with people in the movie business, it was clear that they were caught completely off guard, and many are livid at the prospect of a diminishing of what has been the most hallowed award in all of entertainment (and that somehow, the academy board, drawn from the most gossip-riddled industry in the land, managed to keep a secret until it was a fait accompli).
The huge No. 1 entrance to the marketplace was on par with last summer’s Batman sequel, “The Dark Knight,” which sold \$203.8 million in tickets over the same period and now ranks as one of the biggest blockbusters in movie history with over \$1 billion in global sales
