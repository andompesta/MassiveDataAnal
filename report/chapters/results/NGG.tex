	{\textbf{Result:} bird escaped unharmed but lost its bread,' CERN said in a statement. The 27 kilometre-long particle collider, which runs in a circular tunnel under the French-Swiss border near Geneva, has been plagued by problems since it was briefly started in September 2008. CERN said the latest incident was minor and did not affect attempts to restart the accelerator later this month following repairs.
	
	It was the first time protons have traveled in the giant particle accelerator since last September when the first attempts to turn on the \$6 billion machine ended in a fury of sparks and smoke \ldots

{\textbf{Result:}  The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) says two beams of protons circulating simultaneously led to collisions at least four times during the afternoon and evening.


CERN’s director, Rolf Heuer, said in a statement, “It’s great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,” but he and others cautioned that there was a long way to go before the collider started producing the physics it was designed for\ldots

{\textbf{Result:} In my conversations with people in the movie business, it was clear that they were caught completely off guard, and many are livid at the prospect of a diminishing of what has been the most hallowed award in all of entertainment (and that somehow, the academy board, drawn from the most gossip-riddled industry in the land, managed to keep a secret until it was a fait accompli).

Executives argue that the best-picture award continues to have resonance with consumers when used as a laurel in ads precisely because it is such a rare jewel, and that the Oscars have maintained their distance from secondary awards like the Golden Globes and the Broadcast Film Critics Association by nominating five best, not 10\ldots
