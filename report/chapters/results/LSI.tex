	{\textbf{Result:} CERN expects to have the accelerator running again in the middle of November and to begin colliding protons before Christmas, but a lower energy than originally advertised.
	
	The machine was designed to accelerate the protons to 7 trillion electron volts before colliding them, but the laboratory had already announced that problems with the magnets and connections between them would restrict the energies to only about half that, about 3.5 trillion electron volts, when collisions begin in earnest next year.} \\

{\textbf{Result:} In round 13 the Storm's Maroons stars hammered the Broncos 48-4 following Origin I, but today - four days after Queensland wrapped up the series - it was a far different story.

Canberra put together three tries to one in the following half and extended its lead to 20-4 after Justin Carney scored a breakaway try early after the restart.

The Storm mounted a late comeback with two tries as the Raiders' conceded the impetus, but the hosts managed to hang on for their first victory in three starts and a first defeat of Melbourne since 2002.

Terry Campese was delighted with the drought-breaking win, and perhaps having proven a point to Bellamy after he was dropped from the NSW side for Origin II.\"It's great to get a win finally against them.

That was an awesome win to be a part of,\" he told ABC Grandstand.

Music publishing, on the other hand, is reliable, tethered  to the constellation of tunes that envelop us on  radio and television, and in movies, malls, elevators and greeting cards.}  \\
