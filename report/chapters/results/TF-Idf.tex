	{\textbf{Result:}Bits of a French loaf dropped on an external electrical power supply caused a short circuit last week, triggering failsafe devices that shut down part of the cooling system of the giant experiment to probe the secrets of the universe.The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) says the system was restored several hours after the incident last week while the multi-billion-dollar Large Hadron Collider was barely affected.\"The bird escaped unharmed but lost its bread,\" CERN said in a statement.The 27 kilometre-long particle collider, which runs in a circular tunnel under the French-Swiss border near Geneva, has been plagued by problems since it was briefly started in September 2008.CERN said the latest incident was minor and did not affect attempts to restart the accelerator later this month following repairs.\"It made for a small warming from absolute zero (minus 273 degrees Celsius) to minus 268 degrees but the machine was not stopped,\" the spokeswoman said.Designed to shed light on the origins of the universe, the LHC at CERN took nearly 20 years to complete and cost six billion Swiss francs (\$6.4 billion) to build.The bird was believed to be an owl.- AFP}
