We can distinguish two main subgoals in our project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item compute the correlation between tweet and news
	\item create a summary of the main event that caused the sentiment shift
\end{itemize}
There are several works, in literature, which refer to similar tasks. 
In particular, due to Twitter's increasing popularity, in the last years there
have been several works regarding the correlation and analysis of the data.
Weiwei Guo et al.\cite{LTN} proposed a framework to link tweets and news and to
extract from the resulting correlation missing aspects of the tweet-event. 
In their research, rather than using a LSI technique, they propose a
methodologies based on the Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization\cite{WTMF}
[WTMF] model(the 2012 de facto standard). This approach revealed to return
good correlation results, making WTMF a strong tool for baseline creation.

Some works which are complementary with respect to our might be found in the
field of recommendation systems; in particular systems which address the
problem of recommending news given some user's features. However, there is an
important difference between this task and our, since tweets are much more
heterogeneous and characterized by a much smaller length than news.

Recently \emph{Google} presented a system for \emph{multi-sentence compression} (MSC) \cite{MSC}, which aims
to compress several senteces trying to mantain high readability and to not lose
the semantic content of the text. Their approach exploits word gram graphs,
combining them with some semantic data. The combination of the two approaches
allows redundancy removal while mantaining a readable sentence as output.

%MSC to be quite similar to the NGG approach and obtain probably obtain better summarization results, but since we prefer a system that is as much as possible language-independent we decide to use NGG.
