To compare the results of the different methods, we performed a summative user evaluation. We asked to the user to mark each summary in a scale from 1 to 5. As a suggestion, we gave the following meaning to each mark:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1}. The summary is completely out of topic.
\item \textbf{2}. The topic can be deduced but it's not explicit, the event is not mentioned.
\item \textbf{3}. The topic is correct but the event is not mentioned.
\item \textbf{4}. The topic is correct and the event can be deduced.
\item \textbf{5}. The summary is correct.
\end{itemize}
