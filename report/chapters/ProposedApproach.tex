In this section we present four different approaches that might be used to solve the problem we are investigating. 
Of course, each approach has advantages and disadvantages, which we will list while describing them.
The set of proposed approaches is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Space Saving
	\item LSI - Latent Semantic Indexing
	\item TF-IDF - Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency
	\item N-Gram Graphs
\end{enumerate}
