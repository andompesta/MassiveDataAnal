In this section, we present four different approaches that might be used to solve the problem we are investigating. 
Our approaches are implemented on top of a number of different algorithms, metrics and data structures.
Of course, each one has advantages and disadvantages that will be discussed.
% NOTA: ho commentato questa lista perche' c'e' gia' poco sopra, non credo sia il caso di ripeterla uguale.
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Space Saving algorithm;
%	\item TF/IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency) measure;
%	\item LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing);
%	\item N-Gram Graphs.
