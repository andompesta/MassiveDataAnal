\subsection*{Experimental setup}
In order to perform the experimental evaluation we used a tool to automatically
detect sentiment shift in tweets coming from year 2009 and regarding several
topics. We also downloaded news from the \emph{New York Times} and \emph{ABC
Australia} on the same topic and spanning on the same period of the tweets.

It's important to remember that tweet have different language structure that need to be normalized, so for cleaning purpose, the following operations were performed on the tweet text before starting the computation of all the different methodologies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item URLs removal from tweets using a regular expression
	\item conversion from Unicode to ASCII
\end{itemize}

After that, we manually labelled each contradiction point with the event which
caused it. The topics, contradiction points and events used for the experiments
are showed in table \ref{tab:setup}

All the experiment about Ngram graph where conduced on a 2,4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM memory.
 All the code was compiled with intellij IDEA on Java language. 
The reported test where conduced on Cern topic data set, since is the one that have multiple contradiction points and allowed us to test the methodology changing the following parameter:
\begin{itemize}
	\item rank of the graph
	\item neighbourhood distance[nd]
	\item time windows
\end{itemize}

In figure \ref{fig:et-fixed-10days} is possible to see how is variegating the computational time respect to a fixed time windows of 10days.
Surprisingly for a neighbourhood distance = 3 the computation time with a n-gram graph of rank=3 is higher respect to a rank=2. 
That is quite strange since slicing a text in two-gram should produce more node that slicing a text in three-grams, so we expected a higher computation time for lower value of rank.
Probably with rank = 2 and nd=3, gram near one to the other are always of the same word and having many similar node is easy to compute: the edge connect quite the same node.
This produce a graph smaller that a three-gram graph where we have more distinct n-gram and so more low weight edge to check.

Instead increasing the neighbourhood distance over 3 will increase exponentially the number of nodes check that we have to do in order to compute the edge weight. Increasing the computational time for two-gram graph.
