We also tried an approach based on TF-IDF to correlate the sentiment shifts with the news. TF-IDF is a widely used statistic in NLP and is indeed a effective technique to extract keywords from documents. Our methodology works as follows:
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR {shift in Shifts}
\STATE Compute
\ENDFOR

\end{algorithmic}
