We define \emph{sentiment} the measurement of feelings performed using specific tools analyzing the stream of tweets.
This kind of measurement is usually done using some supervised machine learning techniques together with NLP techniques.

Software tools are available to track the sentiment toward a certain topic and to identify changes in it. In particular we can consider three major events in a sentiment timeline:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item there is a change of sentiment from positive to negative (or
		vice versa)
	\item there is no change of sentiment, but there is a peek in the graph
		describing it or its value crosses the average value
	\item there is no change but in the volume of tweets/second
\end{enumerate}

We define the first of these events as \emph{sentiment shift} and the temporal window in which it happens is called \emph{contradiction point} [CP] or \emph{contradiction window}. 
More over, we define \emph{contradiction tweets} and \emph{contradiction news} respectively the tweets and news published inside a contradiction window.

Given these definitions, the problem we aim to solve is to find, among the contradiction news, the ones, which are the more representative of the contradiction tweets, and to report to the user a summary that describes them.
