The world's biggest physics experiment will begin doing physics this winter at half power, officials at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, said Thursday
The Large Hadron Collider, just outside Geneva, Switzerland, was built to accelerate the subatomic particles called protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and then smash them together in search of forces and particles that existed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old
The collider is plagued by thousands of suspect electrical splices that may not be able to handle the currents required for running at higher energies

Starting in November, the new collider will bang together protons at 35 trillion electron volts
The collider is a gargantuan structure at the European Center for Nuclear Research, called CERN, that scientists have built over generations to help them connect the smallest and largest structures in the universe, and perhaps make sense of why the cosmos is so hospitable to life
