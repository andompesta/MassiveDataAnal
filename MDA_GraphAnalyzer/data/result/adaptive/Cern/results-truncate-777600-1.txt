The machine was designed to accelerate the protons to 7 trillion electron volts before colliding them, but the laboratory had already announced that problems with the magnets and connections between them would restrict the energies to only about half that, about 35 trillion electron volts, when collisions begin in earnest next yearThe lab now says the first collisions, before Christmas, will be even lower, due to delays in finishing a system to protect the powerful superconducting magnets from explosive failures
Scientists at CERN have sent a beam of protons into the Large Hadron Collider, and ran them part way around the giant underground ring successfully before dumping them
Over the weekend of October 25-27 scientists at CERN sent a beam of protons into the Large Hadron Collider, and ran them part way around the giant underground ring successfully before dumping them
It was the first time protons have traveled in the giant particle accelerator since last September when the first attempts to turn on the $6 billion machine ended in a fury of sparks and smoke
