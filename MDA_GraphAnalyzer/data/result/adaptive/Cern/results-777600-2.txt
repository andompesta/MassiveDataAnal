The collider was designed to investigate what happens at energies and temperatures so high that the reigning theory of particle physics called the Standard Model breaks down
When the beams began circulating again on Friday, CERN officials said they expected the first collisions to happen in early December
Other physics labs, like the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, have converted their accelerators into powerful X-ray sources, which can be used to plumb the properties and structures of molecules in work that led to this yearâ€™s Nobel Prize in chemistry
Subsequent work revealed that the machine was riddled with thousands of connections unable to handle the high currents required to run the collider at its intended energy
