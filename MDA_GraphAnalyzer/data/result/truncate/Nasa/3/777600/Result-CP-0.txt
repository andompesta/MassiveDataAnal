Monologue | Aired Tuesday night on NBC: NASA’s been on a campaign to ease people’s fears about the end of the world in 2012. Does anybody really think this is going to happen? … NASA announced that the movie “2012″ is fiction and the Mayan calendar is wrong. And there is no mystery planet headed towards Earth that’s gonna destroy it. People believe this stuff. They say the only thing that can really destroy the planet by 2012 would be, I guess, Countrywide Mortgage, A.I.G., and Wall Street.
