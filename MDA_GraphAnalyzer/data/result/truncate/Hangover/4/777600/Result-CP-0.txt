Strong word of mouth, and a hunger in the marketplace for a female-driven movie, propelled “The Proposal” to No. 1 at the weekend box office. The romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock, right, and Ryan Reynolds sold an estimated $34.1 million in tickets at North American theaters, according to box office tracking services. The unexpectedly robust opening was the biggest of Ms. Bullock’s career and gives a much-needed boost to Walt Disney Pictures, which has been struggling to find live-action hits. Fewer people heeded Sony’s call to  “meet your ancestors” in “Year One.” That  comedy, starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, was the other major release of the weekend and sold an estimated $20.2 million in tickets, only enough for  a fourth-place finish.  No. 2 for the weekend was  Warner Brothers’ film “The Hangover,” which sold an estimated $26.9 million for a three-week total of $152.9 million. Pixar’s “Up” was third with an estimated $21 million in sales ($224 million total), while  Sony’s remake “The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3” was fifth, with an estimated $11.3 million ($43.3 million). Box office analysts were surprised at how well Woody Allen’s latest effort, “Whatever Works,” performed in limited release. The film opened in just nine theaters for $202,720, but the per-theater of average of $31,191 was “massive,” said Paul Dergarabedian of Hollywood.com, a box office tracking service.
