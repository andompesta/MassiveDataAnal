An article on Thursday about proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, referred incorrectly to the origin of the World Wide Web, which was invented there
With little fanfare this time around, engineers and scientists at CERN are planning to restart the Large Hadron Collider early Saturday morning, sending a beam of protons around the 18-mile-underground racetrack for the first time since September 2008
Over the weekend of October 25-27 scientists at CERN sent a beam of protons into the Large Hadron Collider, and ran them part way around the giant underground ring successfully before dumping them
Scientists at CERN have sent a beam of protons into the Large Hadron Collider, and ran them part way around the giant underground ring successfully before dumping them
The initial collisions will be at 11 trillion electron volts per beam, just barely above the energy of the Tevatron collider now running at CERNâ€™s rival, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago
