CERN expects to have the accelerator running again in the middle of November and to begin colliding protons before Christmas, but a lower energy than originally advertised
The lab now says the first collisions, before Christmas, will be even lower, due to delays in finishing a system to protect the powerful superconducting magnets from explosive failures
The initial collisions will be at 11 trillion electron volts per beam, just barely above the energy of the Tevatron collider now running at CERNâ€™s rival, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago
The machine was designed to accelerate the protons to 7 trillion electron volts before colliding them, but the laboratory had already announced that problems with the magnets and connections between them would restrict the energies to only about half that, about 35 trillion electron volts, when collisions begin in earnest next year
