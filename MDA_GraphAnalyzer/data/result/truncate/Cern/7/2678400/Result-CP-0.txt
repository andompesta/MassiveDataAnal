The collider is a gargantuan structure at the European Center for Nuclear Research, called CERN, that scientists have built over generations to help them connect the smallest and largest structures in the universe, and perhaps make sense of why the cosmos is so hospitable to life
I could even talk about the “teeny weeny” black holes that we may create at the world’s largest particle physics laboratory called CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research
The world's biggest physics experiment will begin doing physics this winter at half power, officials at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, said Thursday
The Large Hadron Collider, just outside Geneva, Switzerland, was built to accelerate the subatomic particles called protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and then smash them together in search of forces and particles that existed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old
The collider, a giant machine outside Geneva that is hunting for subatomic particles that could help explain the origin of the universe, was already idle and behind schedule during the recent visit to Belize
