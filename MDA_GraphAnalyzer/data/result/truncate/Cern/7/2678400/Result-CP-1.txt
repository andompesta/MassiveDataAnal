With little fanfare this time around, engineers and scientists at CERN are planning to restart the Large Hadron Collider early Saturday morning, sending a beam of protons around the 18-mile-underground racetrack for the first time since September 2008
the machine is designed to produce and collide protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy
The machine was designed to accelerate the protons to 7 trillion electron volts before colliding them, but the laboratory had already announced that problems with the magnets and connections between them would restrict the energies to only about half that, about 35 trillion electron volts, when collisions begin in earnest next yearThe lab now says the first collisions, before Christmas, will be even lower, due to delays in finishing a system to protect the powerful superconducting magnets from explosive failures
Over the weekend of October 25-27 scientists at CERN sent a beam of protons into the Large Hadron Collider, and ran them part way around the giant underground ring successfully before dumping them
