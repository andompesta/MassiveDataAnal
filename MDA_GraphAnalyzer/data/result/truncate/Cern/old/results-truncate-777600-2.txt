the machine is designed to produce and collide protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy
The first time protons circled the collider, on Sept
If all goes well, the protons should start finally colliding in the collider two weeks later, at a starter energy of 450 billion electron volts apiece
outside Geneva, scientists at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, succeeded in sending beams of protons clockwise around the 17-mile underground magnetic racetrack known as the Large Hadron Collider, the worldâ€™s biggest and most expensive physics experiment
With little fanfare this time around, engineers and scientists at CERN are planning to restart the Large Hadron Collider early Saturday morning, sending a beam of protons around the 18-mile-underground racetrack for the first time since September 2008
Those first collisions will occur at the so-called injection energy of 450 billion electron volts
When the collider begins to do real physics next year, it will run at half its original design energy, with protons of 35 trillion electron volts
