The world's biggest physics experiment will begin doing physics this winter at half power, officials at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, said Thursday
The Large Hadron Collider, just outside Geneva, Switzerland, was built to accelerate the subatomic particles called protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and then smash them together in search of forces and particles that existed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old
The collider is plagued by thousands of suspect electrical splices that may not be able to handle the currents required for running at higher energies

But soon? This week, scientists and engineers at the European Center for Nuclear Research, or CERN, are to announce how and when their machine will start running this winter
