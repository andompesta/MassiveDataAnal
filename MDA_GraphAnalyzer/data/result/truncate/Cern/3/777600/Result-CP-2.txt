the machine is designed to produce and collide protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy
The first time protons circled the collider, on Sept
The collider first boosted a beam of protons to the new energy record of 12 trillion electron volts on Nov
If all goes well, the protons should start finally colliding in the collider two weeks later, at a starter energy of 450 billion electron volts apiece
outside Geneva, scientists at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, succeeded in sending beams of protons clockwise around the 17-mile underground magnetic racetrack known as the Large Hadron Collider, the worldâ€™s biggest and most expensive physics experiment
Scientists said that the new Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile loop underneath the Swiss-French border, had accelerated protons to energies of 12 trillion electron volts apiece and then crashed them together, eclipsing a record for collisions held by an American machine, the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois
