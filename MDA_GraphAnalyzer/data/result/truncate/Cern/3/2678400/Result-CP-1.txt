the machine is designed to produce and collide protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy
With little fanfare this time around, engineers and scientists at CERN are planning to restart the Large Hadron Collider early Saturday morning, sending a beam of protons around the 18-mile-underground racetrack for the first time since September 2008
The machine was designed to accelerate the protons to 7 trillion electron volts before colliding them, but the laboratory had already announced that problems with the magnets and connections between them would restrict the energies to only about half that, about 35 trillion electron volts, when collisions begin in earnest next yearThe lab now says the first collisions, before Christmas, will be even lower, due to delays in finishing a system to protect the powerful superconducting magnets from explosive failures
The engineers also ran lead ions around part of the machine for the first time; they will eventually be collided in hopes of producing a so-called quark-gluon plasmaCERN expects to have the accelerator running again in the middle of November and to begin colliding protons before Christmas, but a lower energy than originally advertised
