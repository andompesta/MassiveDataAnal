The Large Hadron Collider, just outside Geneva, Switzerland, was built to accelerate the subatomic particles called protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and then smash them together in search of forces and particles that existed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old
The collider is a gargantuan structure at the European Center for Nuclear Research, called CERN, that scientists have built over generations to help them connect the smallest and largest structures in the universe, and perhaps make sense of why the cosmos is so hospitable to life
I could even talk about the “teeny weeny” black holes that we may create at the world’s largest particle physics laboratory called CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research
The world's biggest physics experiment will begin doing physics this winter at half power, officials at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, said Thursday
Physicists at the collider say they hope to capture that particle, which supposedly explains the origin of mass, and perhaps a few other particles that could point to an extension of the modelFor his part, Albert, who appeared to be very well read on the topic, took a hard line on the disappearance of the Mayas at Xunantunich, asserting that they were forced to leave solely because they failed to rotate their crops“There was no food,” said Albert, who said that he had some Maya blood on his mother’s sideWhatever the true cause of the Maya exodus, a CERN spokesman, James Gillies, said that he did not expect the laboratory to suffer a similar fate any time soon
