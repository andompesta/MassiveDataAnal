The documentary compiled from Michael Jackson‘s rehearsals for the concert series he was preparing when he died will be released in theaters earlier than expected and will be shown for only two weeks. In a news release, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment said that the documentary, called “Michael Jackson THIS IS IT,” would open on Oct. 28, two days sooner than originally announced, and that tickets for the film would go on sale Sept. 27 in most cities. The movie will be directed by Kenny Ortega, the director and choreographer who was working with Mr. Jackson on his planned “This Is It” concerts, a series of 50 shows that Mr. Jackson was to have performed at London’s O2 Arena beginning in July. Sony which paid $60 million for the film in a deal between the studio, the Jackson estate and the concert promoter AEG Live, said the documentary would draw upon more than 100 hours of behind-the-scenes footage and rehearsals shot between April and June.
The Apollo Theater in Harlem, which after Michael Jackson's death became a  mourning place and gathering site for his fans, will induct Jackson into its Apollo Legends Hall of Fame, the theater said on Tuesday. The Apollo, a nonprofit theater, said Jackson's posthumous induction would take place at a gala next year. Jackson will also receive a spot on the Apollo's Walk of Fame, which is scheduled to be constructed in the fall, and will be given a memorial plaque at the theater in the spring alongside fellow inductees like James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald. The Apollo also said that its archives would take possession of a 100-foot-long blue plywood wall outside the theater that was used as a memorial by  Jackson's fans after his death in June, and which was donated to the theater by the owners of an adjacent property.
