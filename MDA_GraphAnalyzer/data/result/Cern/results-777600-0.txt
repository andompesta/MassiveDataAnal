The Large Hadron Collider, just outside Geneva, Switzerland, was built to accelerate the subatomic particles called protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and then smash them together in search of forces and particles that existed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old
The collider was built to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and smash them together in search of particles and forces that reigned earlier than the first trillionth of a second of time, but the machine could run as low as four trillion electron volts for its first year
